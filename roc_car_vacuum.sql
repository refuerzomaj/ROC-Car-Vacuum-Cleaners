I&#8217;m your host Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:00:40]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today I&#8217;m talking about Five for the Future– again. Before we get stuck right into the heart of it, 10 episodes ago, in episode 25, I focused on the Five for the Future initiative and I recommend that you listen to that before you join me in today&#8217;s episode. It&#8217;s only eight minutes and it gives you a history of the Five for the Future initiative, as well as some information on the Five for the Future program.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It then goes on to talk about some of the original intentions behind that original initiative. The reason I bring this back up today is partially because one, I will talk about both the program and the initiative it&#8217;s based on literally anytime. I believe strongly that they are both a vital part of what will result in a triumph of the commons of WordPress, and keep this empowering project around for years to come.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I also bring it up today because there&#8217;s conversation about a post I published a couple of months back that has generated some dialogue around the intentions of this catchy call to contribution. So to make sure that as we move through this discussion together, we are working with as much factual information as possible, I present to you some facts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:01:46]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First and foremost, the pillars of this initiative. The 5% in Five for the Future is aspirational. Contribution to open source is a question and indication of privilege. So the 5% is not a requirement, but rather it&#8217;s an aim. It could refer to 5% of your time or 5% of your resources, or just any amount of your time or resources around. Regardless of how you&#8217;re defining it, it is an aspiration, not a requirement.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second pillar, pledges show your intention and whatever contributions you are able to offer after you&#8217;ve made your pledge are always welcome. No one is out there checking for 100% completion of the hours that you intended to give back to WordPress versus the hours that you actually succeeded at giving back to WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are so many volunteers that make sure that this project is running and functional and has plenty of people knowing how to get things done and how to teach others how to get things done. It&#8217;s all coming from generosity of heart.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:02:52]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And speaking of generosity, the third thing that is important about this initiative is that it insists on and wants to celebrate a culture of generosity. Beyond the concept of a pledge, is the idea of generous collaboration toward the long term health and stability of our project for the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As contributors, we understand that we are greater than the sum of our parts and what we build <em>within</em> WordPress empowers those who build <em>with</em> WordPress. So those are the pillars that went into that initial thought, that opening Five for the Future call to action that Matt gave to everybody in 2014.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so now I want to share with you some of the pillars of the program that has grown up around it. So the Five for the Future initiative, if you&#8217;re not familiar, was started in 2014 and is a grand call to all of us to remember to give back to the shared commons of WordPress. Its aim was to help guard against what is called the “tragedy of the commons,” where resources are continually taken out and not necessarily reinvested in. No one&#8217;s necessarily putting anything back into those.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:04:06]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that&#8217;s the starting point for all of this. So the program, the Five for the Future program, in 2018 was built as a collaborative effort with full participation and buy-in from the contributors who were active in the project at the time. It allowed anyone to raise their hands, to show support of WordPress via a pledge and also started a multi-year discussion of how to define contributions in a way that let us automatically provide props and therefore more effectively put badges on people&#8217;s wordpress.org profiles.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then in 2019, there was an additional pilot of the program, which kind of offered some team structure, which was intended to not only take on work that I don&#8217;t like to ask volunteers to do, but also to provide some checks and balances to an absolute raft of sponsored contributor hours that we had started to see show up.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Which brings us then to the post that I mentioned at the start. Knowledgeable supporters of the WordPress open source project have debated next iterations to Five for the Future activity and programming. So, to bring the conversation to a central set of questions, or rather to bring the conversation to a central spot, I raised these two questions. One, what activities can we see inside our contributor networks? So wordpress.org, make.wordpress.org, the Rosetta sites that we have, Slack, et cetera.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:05:30]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what activities can we see inside the contributor networks that we can flag to enable easier distribution of props and therefore badges? The second question is, what activities can we see also in those contributor networks that appear to be contributions, but in the end are only benefiting the person or company that provides the contributions?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For what it&#8217;s worth that discussion then also raised a third question that I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;ve even started to tackle, which is what about the activities that are not in the contributor network, but still do move WordPress forward? Cause there are so, so many of those things and it&#8217;s a great question. I don&#8217;t have an answer and just so that I don&#8217;t leave you all with a series of questions for which there are no answers provided in this particular podcast, I do have a few answers for questions that I have seen floating around this discussion.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the first question is actually a bunch of questions. There are like three parts to it. What are props, who gives props, and who tracks them? So ‘props’ is a term used in WordPress to describe shared recognition of a contribution. Think of it as like a hat tip or kudos or an assist. However you think about it, it&#8217;s recognition of the other people who helped to solve a problem along the way. That is what props are.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:06:47]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second part of that question is who gives props and historically developers have given props, which tends to mean that it&#8217;s mostly developers who get props. But now, also, any team rep during a release cycle can provide props to folks on their team, volunteers on their team who were really helpful during the course of the release.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And recently we also added the functionality for ad hoc props to be given in the Slack props channel, and those get added to your profile activity. So that someone can give you basically a public thanks for having helped on something that they were working on. And then that gets logged in your activity tracker on your WordPress.org profile.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the final question in that first big question is who tracks these props? And the answer is human beings! Which is why folks feel like they have to do a ton of things before they even get props. And that&#8217;s also why I&#8217;d like to automate more and more of them so that you don&#8217;t have to do a ton of things in order for someone to show up and acknowledge that you are part of a solution.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:07:51]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the second question that I&#8217;ve seen kind of running around is, where do props start? And that is a great question that has been asked year after year. And one that I think we should continue to ask. The reality is that we won&#8217;t be able to see every contribution to WordPress, but that doesn&#8217;t mean that they aren&#8217;t valuable. And it doesn&#8217;t mean that they don&#8217;t matter.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Building our culture of generosity helps us to better recognize and celebrate each other for all of our contributions, whether they are for a major release or a major event, or one of these new ad hoc props that you can offer to people. And if we see more and more of the same type of contributions being celebrated, then we can also work toward automating those as well, so that you don&#8217;t have to do a super ton of them before someone has noticed that you&#8217;ve done even one of them.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the third big question that has been running around is, what about the people who don&#8217;t want the props? If people want to be literally anonymous, then deletion requests are probably your way to go. But I actually don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s the question here. I think the question is what if a prop holds no intrinsic value to you and then, you know, I wanna thank you for that spirit of generosity. And I also wanna say that I&#8217;m so glad you&#8217;re here.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:09:02]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hopefully, all of these answers clarify what lies at the heart of what is intended with the Five for the Future initiative and the program that&#8217;s built on top of it. And why I care so much about fixing the ways we offer props to folks. For me, it&#8217;s not about assessing the worthiness of people or companies or any of their contributions. For me, it&#8217;s about reinvesting in the shared commons of the WordPress ecosystem, by finding a way that our economy can entice folks to put back into WordPress, something close to the benefit that they receive from it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that brings us now to our small list of big things. Thank you all for making it into the final stretches with me. These three things that I&#8217;m sharing also have companion blog posts to go with them because they are very big questions or very big features, very big plugin kind of things that we&#8217;re looking at. And so you&#8217;ll be able to find those in the show notes, or you can go to wordpress.org/news if you&#8217;re listening to this in a podcast player of your choice that is not wordpress.org.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:10:10]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the first one on my list is a new plugin. It is called Create Block Theme. And it&#8217;s gonna make it easier for theme builders to use the existing site editor tools to create new block themes. I&#8217;m very excited about this. Uh, you can find it on make.wordpress.org/themes. And I will also include a link to it in the show notes below.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If themes are not your area of expertise, but you are interested in documentation or the DevHub or to an extent design things, then the improvements that are being worked on for the DevHub are definitely in your area. That&#8217;s kind of a Meta task, but has a few other pieces involved as well. That can be found on make.wordpress.org/meta. But again, I will have a link to the very, very detailed blog post in the show notes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s got a bunch of hypothetical changes that are being suggested for the WordPress developer docs, uh, especially when it comes to the function reference. And so there are gonna be some slight design questions, but not like, graphic design/visual design, more in the like, can humans read this design area of things? And so that will be a good one to look at. If you are sort of in the Meta or Documentation vein of things in the way that you like to contribute to WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:011:30]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the final thing is about open sourcing theme designs. So open sourcing everything obviously is important to us. And the design tool that we use, this tool called Figma, is open to the public. And so it&#8217;s possible for folks to be able to kind of get in there and use and reuse any design elements.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so there&#8217;s a discussion happening over on make.wordpress.org/design about how that can and should look in the future. And so if design is definitely your area, and again, this kind of lines up with themes a little bit, then wander over into that one, for which there will also be a link in the show notes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that my friends is your small list of big things. Thank you for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. And I&#8217;ll see you again in a couple of weeks.</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"13132\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:2;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:60:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n		\n\n					\n										\n					\n		\n		\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:6:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:36:\"The Month in WordPress – June 2022\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:68:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2022/07/the-month-in-wordpress-june-2022/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 06 Jul 2022 14:19:50 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:2:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:18:\"Month in WordPress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:18:\"month in wordpress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=13069\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:313:\"With WordPress 6.1 already in the works, a lot of updates happened during June.

The potential and power of blogs would be an influence in the rest of his life.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/06/leo-gopal.jpeg?fit=720%2C960&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Leo sat in front of a pond. \" class=\"wp-image-13027\" width=\"720\" height=\"960\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/06/leo-gopal.jpeg?w=720&amp;ssl=1 720w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/06/leo-gopal.jpeg?resize=225%2C300&amp;ssl=1 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>As Leo&#8217;s confidence grew through expressing himself in writing, he was determined that his stutter would &#8216;no longer hold power over him&#8217;. In 2005, with the encouragement of his blog readers, he spent his school summer break in his room working on reducing his stutter. WordPress would be the tool that would enable him to connect with his blog readers and to express his creativity and thoughts.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Making WordPress your own</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In high school, Leo had opted for programming as one of his subjects. In 2008, he built his first website using WordPress for the students at the school. This was the first time he saw the real value of WordPress and open source.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During the following years, he increasingly spent time searching online for information on &#8216;Customising WordPress&#8217; and &#8216;Making WordPress your own&#8217;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Leo wanted to keep busy and as soon as he finished school, he applied for every entry-level web-related job that he could find. He was hired by a company for the role of webmaster for its Marketing team focused on WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He continued to grow his skills as a WordPress developer with the help of useful documentation that he could find and through his helpful local WordPress Community. This helped him earn a living and support his family.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Helping yourself through helping others in the community</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2015, Leo moved full-time to Cape Town, South Africa, and started as a developer at a web development agency, eventually progressing to its Head of Development and managing a small team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He chose WordPress as his main platform for development mainly because of the community behind it.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>“<em>Had it not been for those searches on how to make WordPress your own, my life would have turned out a lot differently</em>.”&nbsp;</p><cite>Leo Gopal</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Leo felt he had a hurdle to overcome working in web sector. He didn’t feel like a ‘real developer’ being self-taught. However, through the community, he realized that there were many self-taught developers and he was not alone.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alongside his development path, Leo faced a mental health journey. He had suffered from depression and found the community to be accepting and understanding of this.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At WordCamp Cape Town 2016, he stood in front of an audience and gave a talk: “<a href=\"https://wordpress.tv/2016/11/24/leo-gopal-the-wordpress-community-mental-wellness-and-you/\">The WordPress Community, Mental Wellness, and You</a>”. Following this talk, he was greeted by many attendees who thanked him for talking so openly about mental health issues.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/06/Leo-speaking-2.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Leo speaking at the podium at WordCamp Cape Town in 2016\" class=\"wp-image-13023\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/06/Leo-speaking-2.jpeg?w=1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/06/Leo-speaking-2.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/06/Leo-speaking-2.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Leo speaking at a WordCamp</em> Cape Town, 2016</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Leo has been diagnosed with bipolar, previously known as manic depression.

He has also spoken at a number of WordCamps.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maintaining connections with people he had met through these events Leo felt was a great aid to his mental wellbeing during the Covid pandemic. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>He has contributed to core and plugins and believes that WordPress and its community make it extremely easy to contribute. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>“<em>The cost to start contributing is extremely low &#8211; start now</em>”.</p><cite>Leo Gopal</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>When the ability to create and add patterns to the WordPress.org library came out in 2021, Leo used it almost immediately and created a <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/patterns/pattern/call-to-action-section-2/\">call-to-action box</a> which could be used by both his clients and the community.

And welcome to the WordPress Briefing, the podcast where you can catch quick explanations of some of the ideas behind the WordPress open source project and the community around it, as well as get a small list of big things coming up in the next two weeks. I&#8217;m your host Josepha Haden Chomphosy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here we go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All right my friends. So it&#8217;s been about a month since WordPress 6.0 came out and you know what that means. It means we are already looking at the next major WordPress release because,&nbsp; as most of you know, WordPress never sleeps. Y&#8217;all are honestly up and hustling like 24/7 as far as I can tell, which is great! And is one of the many benefits of being a global community, I suppose.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:01:05]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But anyway, back to this major release. There was a high-level roadmap shared by Mattias Ventura at the start of June. And it lists some focus areas for the Block Editor, continued refinements to the template editor and navigation block, and some work on global styles and more / better blocks and design tools that are slated to ship with WordPress 6.1. From the WordPress core side, though, there are a couple hundred tickets that are milestoned for the next major.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Being milestoned for a release means that either a ticket wasn&#8217;t ready for the last release and was moved to the next available one, or a ticket has become ready for a release since the last major release occurred. That list as it stands might be a little bit too big for a single release. However, honestly, no list is too big if we have enough folks contributing.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if you&#8217;ve never contributed to a major release of WordPress before, and you&#8217;re interested to know how that works, there are some things to keep an eye out for over the next few weeks. We are in what is considered the planning phase for the next big release. And so there are two or three things you&#8217;re gonna see pretty soon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:02:11]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First is a planning kickoff post. That post gets published on make.wordpress.org/core, and it includes notes on volunteering for the release squad, some guesses at areas of focus based on the tickets that we&#8217;re seeing in track, a schedule, the whole kit, and caboodle. It&#8217;s all in there. If you are wanting to know how to lend a hand and how to take your first steps to core contribution, apart from the new contributor meeting that happens before the dev chat, that post is the place to start.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So keep an eye out on make.wordpress.org/core for that. And then the second thing that shows up in the planning phase for any major release is bug scrub and ticket triage meetings. Like I mentioned, there are the new contributor meetings where they scrub tickets and talk through the basics of what we&#8217;re seeing on good first bugs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I mentioned that here often, I just mentioned it in the last, in the last bullet point, but there are also regular bug scrubs and ticket triaging sessions where a kind contributor chooses a set of tickets to review and then leads other contributors through the process of checking to see if a ticket is valid to see if it can be replicated to see if it has a patch.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:03:23]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If there are decisions that are blocking it and how to move those decisions forward, and generally just kind of discuss what else has to be done in order to take the ticket to the next step. Those get announced in the dev chat every Wednesday, but also there is a post that will go up on make.wordpress.org/core.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I wish I had a faster way to say that instead of just racing through the whole URL every time. But it&#8217;ll be okay. We&#8217;ll put it in the show notes in case you would rather just click some stuff. And the third thing to keep an eye out for. If development is not your thing, so writing code is not already part of your tool belt, that&#8217;s totally fine. There are many other important areas where you can contribute, too. Design, training, support, polyglots, marketing, documentation, and more. These teams all do work in and around a release that is vital to WordPress&#8217; overall success.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:04:19]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And a final thought of all. If that felt a little too intense if you want to see where this ship is headed, but you can&#8217;t quite commit to grabbing an oar today, that&#8217;s fine, too. The most important thing is that if you are a member of the community, as an extender or a user or a die-hard contributor, or a new contributor, the most important thing is that you have some general awareness of what the overall direction is.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You might do that by experimenting with blocks in your products or by testing screen readers against your workflow or even by setting aside an hour to participate in the latest testing prompt. Being aware of what&#8217;s happening in and around your area of the project will help to keep you kind of prepared and knowledgeable to lend a hand whenever it is that you are ready.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:05:14]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that then brings us to our small list of big things. My friends, registration is now open for the WordPress Speaker Workshop for Women Voices in India. That&#8217;s taking place on September 24th and 25th. Uh, it&#8217;s happening over Zoom, so location or travel shouldn&#8217;t really be an obstacle for you. I&#8217;m going to leave a link to some information about that in the show notes. It should be an excellent opportunity that [the] WP Diversity initiative that WordPress has, that the community team helps to foster, is really an excellent experience. And so I hope that you register and attend that.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the second thing actually is a bit of a celebration. The Photo Directory recently hit a huge milestone of 3000 photos! And you also can submit your photos to wordpress.org/photos. If you feel so inclined to make a contribution of that type.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:06:07]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the third thing on my smallest of big things is actually kind of a, a WordPress tooltip a little bit of a WordPress project did-ya-know? So, there is a special channel in WordPress Slack for sharing thanks to folks who were especially helpful to you. It&#8217;s called the Props Channel. And when someone shares props with you, it even shows up in your activity on your wordpress.org profile. Pretty cool, huh? Props to the Meta team for that one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that my friends is your small list of big things. Thank you for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. And I&#8217;ll see you again in a couple of weeks.</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"13013\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:5;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:61:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n		\n\n					\n										\n					\n		\n		\n\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:7:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:59:\"WP Briefing: Episode 33: Some Important Questions from WCEU\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:81:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2022/06/episode-33-some-important-questions-from-wceu/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 13 Jun 2022 11:01:44 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:2:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7:\"Podcast\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:11:\"wp-briefing\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:53:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?post_type=podcast&p=13005\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:165:\"WordPress Executive Director Josepha Haden Chomphosy covers some important questions from WordCamp Europe on this special episode of the WordPress Briefing podcast. \";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:9:\"enclosure\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:0:\"\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:3:{s:3:\"url\";s:60:\"https://wordpress.org/news/files/2022/06/WP-Briefing-033.mp3\";s:6:\"length\";s:1:\"0\";s:4:\"type\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Santana Inniss\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:40:\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/\";a:1:{s:7:\"encoded\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13788:\"\n<p>In the thirty-third episode of the WordPress Briefing, hear Josepha Haden Chomphosy recap important questions from WordCamp Europe, and a selection of Contributor Day interviews. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>Have a question you&#8217;d like answered?

It&#8217;s a big part of our business. And I think it&#8217;s like WordPress is a big part of all the hosting company, company’s, businesses, you know? So for us, it is like, we want to make it better. We want to give back. We want to understand, you know, where we can contribute the most. And we see it as a, you know, win, win, win situation for everyone, for clients, for the whole ecosystem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And for us as a business, of course!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Milana Cap </strong>00:00:32]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My favorite WordPress component is WP CLI. That&#8217;s my crush, haha, because I love terminal. I love doing it. I&#8217;m not a really UI type of person, I get lost in UI. But in terminal, you just type command and it does what you want. And a WP CLI is much more powerful than WordPress dashboard. You can do so many things there and you can have fun.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Uh, so that&#8217;s my go-to tool!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:01:10]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hello everyone. And welcome to the WordPress Briefing– the podcast where you can catch quick explanations of the ideas behind the WordPress open source project, some insight into the community that supports it, and get a small list of big things coming up in the next two weeks. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:01:36]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many, many people were at WordCamp Europe a couple of weeks ago. And at the end, Matt and I closed out the event sessions with a little question and answer time from the community. I was excited to see everyone and excited to answer their questions. But as with all spur of the moment answers, I experienced this <em>l&#8217;esprit de l&#8217;escalier </em>and I found that there were a few things that I would have answered a little more completely if I had taken more than two seconds to think about them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So today I&#8217;m going to augment some of the answers from that session with a little more context and clarity. There was a question from Laura Byrne about favorite blocks in recent WordPress releases. And given that I was exclusively holding WordCamp Europe information in my brain at the time, I couldn&#8217;t think of which block was my favorite. While I was sitting there on that stage,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I realized that one of my favorite things about WordPress’s 6.0 release, like Matt, wasn&#8217;t really a block, but it was a functional workflow sort of thing. So my favorite thing was the ability to lock blocks, but I mean, the question was about favorite blocks. And so I do know that some of the most anticipated blocks are the Flexbox layout blocks. Whew. What a sentence!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:02:46]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Try to say that three times fast! Those blocks are the Flexbox layout blocks, they are sort of shortcuts that show up when you&#8217;re selecting multiple blocks and allow for easy side-by-side layouts. I&#8217;m not explaining it in a way that does it much justice, but I will share a link in the show notes that has more information and you can kind of see how empowering that particular block is in the block editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The next question I wanted to give a little more context to came from Courtney Robertson. She asked about how to make translated content more readily available on learn.wordpress.org. My answer was pretty far ranging and talked about why it&#8217;s harder to commit to prioritizing that over, for my example, translating WordPress core.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I also understand that there are people who want to help and just need someone to point them in the right direction. And so I want to be clear that it is possible to have workshops in any language on learn.wordpress.org right now. We just don&#8217;t have a lot of people contributing those translations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there are conversations going on right now in the training team about using Glotpress on learn.wordpress.org, and also how to translate subtitles. So, if you are looking for ways to give back through translation and training is an important kind of area of your focus. I will have links to both of those things in the show notes as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:04:11]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also gave a quick answer, uh, after this question about how hard it is to recognize contributions that are separate from a major event or major release. In this case, when I say recognize, that&#8217;s recognized as in thank, not recognize as in, know it exists. In case it&#8217;s not clear why that was connected, why that answer was connected to the question, training materials are self-serve and not always specific to individual releases of WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that means the maintenance of any content around training happens routinely over the course of time, rather than because of a specific release or a WordCamp. What sometimes can make it a little harder to entice people to join us in that work.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And now the third question I&#8217;d like to tackle is the one that came from Megan Rose. She asked how we can encourage better diversity as we go back to in-person events. My answer was more about the big picture, program-wide work that has been done and specific awarenesses that I, as a leader, have been keeping top of mind. That answer is still true and is still important, but again, it doesn&#8217;t really help anyone who&#8217;s wondering how they can show up today in their own communities, and do the hard work of fostering an inclusive space there so that we can confidently welcome more diverse voices together.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:05:27]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A great place to start is to have conversations with people who aren&#8217;t like you and really listen. Also recognizing that we all come from different backgrounds that give us more or less opportunity and always be asking yourself, who is missing from this conversation and why, how can I find them and invite them into our own WordPress spaces?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If that all kind of feels right up your alley, I would check out the show notes. I&#8217;ll have some links in there to the community team’s site, as well as a few posts that will help you to explore that a bit further as well.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There were also a couple of questions about market share slash usage of WordPress, and Five for the Future that I really do want to answer, but as I was writing up the context and just kind of exploring the questions that people were raising, it turned out to really be quite a big set of answers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I will do those in either two separate episodes of their own or one surprisingly long, for me, episode. And so there you have it, a lightning round, deep dive on a few questions from WordCamp Europe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Jonathan Desrosiers </strong>00:06:41]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, it&#8217;s definitely great to be back in person. Um, it&#8217;s been a long two years, two or three years for a lot of people and it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s great that we&#8217;re such an asynchronous community and we can all stay connected online through Slack and different means. Um, but there are some things that you can&#8217;t replace, like making friends with people and learning people&#8217;s demeanors and having some discussions in person that you can&#8217;t replace.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so, uh, I&#8217;m really excited to see people I haven&#8217;t seen in a long time. Meet new people and, um, you know, have some of those discussions here today in Portugal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:07:21]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Which then brings us to our small list of big things.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you missed the announcement, WordCamp Europe will be in Athens next year. And the call for organizers is open already. It&#8217;s an experience that is absolutely irreplaceable. So I&#8217;ll link to that in the show notes, in case you&#8217;ve always wanted to give back to WordPress that way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing on my list is that work on the next major release of WordPress is already underway. There is a post with roadmap info that was published recently, as well as a slightly more casual thread on Twitter. I&#8217;ve linked both of those in the show notes, so that you have some concept of what it is that we are aiming for in 6.1, and also a concept of where to go to get started working on it if that&#8217;s what you feel like doing, uh, for the next three to four months– 120 days, roughly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Uh, and finally. This is less of like a thing to be aware of in the next two weeks and kind of a little WordPress project tool tip. Did you know that we have a calendar that shows all meetings for all teams all week long? It will make you feel tired by the amount of work that gets done in the WordPress project every week, but it&#8217;s right there on make.wordpress.org/meetings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you never have to wonder where folks are meeting to talk about things ever again. And that my friends is your small list of big things. Thank you for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy, and I&#8217;ll see you again in a couple of weeks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Santana Inniss &amp; Héctor Prieto </strong>00:09:11]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hello!

She recalls: “No one thought to say, ‘Dee, you look like you’re good at this, you should pursue it…’. I mean, I was a girl (and I was told girls didn’t ‘do’ computers). No one in the circles I moved in really had any idea where this technology revolution would take us.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With no particular career path into technology, Dee was encouraged in her final year of school to apply for a job in a bank where she worked and became a teller three years later. She gained financial independence, which enabled her to travel as a 20-year-old and spend the next three years exploring the US and Europe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Looking back, she noted how the world had changed: the first computer mouse she had seen had come out in 1983, and 20 years later WordPress was founded.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Journey into coding</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>During those 20 years, Dee worked as a nanny, working in child care centers, in customer support, and as a temp.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 1999, she packed up her bags once again, and moved from New Zealand to Australia. She took a place at a performing arts school where she honed her singing and performance skills and volunteered her time to the music director who was starting to experiment with sending out HTML newsletters and updates via email.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“And so my personal revolution began. On the day after I graduated from that course, I walked into a full-time role as that music director’s assistant and began my journey back to code.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As part of that job, Dee edited and sent HTML newsletters on a weekly basis. This ignited her interest in programming, and she bought books about coding for the web and experimented on her home-built PC making web pages. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>“I’m sure, like a lot of us, I remember the thrill of creating that first HTML file and seeing a ‘Hello World’ or similar heading rendered in the browser. From there, I was completely hooked.”</p><cite>Dee Teal</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Later she moved to the IT department and took on maintenance of all the websites. By 2004, she was working full-time as a webmaster. A year later, she was running a small business creating sites on the side. Four years after that, her business became her full-time job as she left employment to pursue her Masters Degree in Digital Communication and Culture.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/R0011864.jpg?resize=1024%2C768&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Dee with other contributors getting things ready for a WordCamp\" class=\"wp-image-12961\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/R0011864.jpg?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/R0011864.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/R0011864.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/R0011864.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption>Dee and other volunteers setting up for a local WordCamp</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Dee found the theory and sociology behind the web, and its facilitation of human and machine communication fascinating.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She said: “I love the fact that the tech industry involves a constant constant curve of growth and discovery, which results in a perpetual exercise in finding creative elegant solutions for sticky problems.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For Dee, being able to use her innate curiosity to leverage processes, people, and tools, fuelled by a focus on communicating a message, has been a defining inspiration in her work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This combined fascination coincided with her meeting WordPress in 2009 and subsequently its community. She moved her existing blog to the software and it became the CMS of choice for all her client work.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The WordPress community can change your world</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2011, she stumbled across WordCamps and by extension the WordPress community. Dee has reflected publicly that WordPress didn’t change her life, its community changed her world!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She flew on a whim from her then home in Sydney to attend a WordCamp in Melbourne she had found after a search for ‘WordPress Conferences’.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She said: “I met welcoming people, made friends, connected, and came back home excited and hopeful about continuing this connection with the wider WordPress community.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Building a community locally around WordPress got off to a slow start in Sydney. From an inauspicious early WordPress Sydney meetup in the function room of a pub, her connection and involvement took off. Before long she was helping organize that meetup, and by the time she moved away from that great city it had branched into two meetups, and soon after, into three.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She was so inspired by the community that at the end of that first year and her second WordCamp, she raised her hand to help organize a WordCamp Sydney in 2012, and after moving interstate, WordCamp Melbourne in 2013.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>&#8220;WordPress and any other software package exist to serve people.&#8221;</p><cite>Dee Teal</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Dee said: “WordPress, software, technology, the Internet will come and go, morph, and change, evolve. Maybe WordPress will last forever, maybe it will morph into something else, maybe one day it will look completely different than it did when I first started (actually, that’s true now). The thing that doesn’t change is the humanity around it. WordPress and any other software package exist to serve people.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She added: “The thing that I have learned, not only through WordPress but in life, is that if we too serve the people around what we’re doing, we ourselves will grow, develop and change alongside the people we serve, and the tools we use to serve them.”</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"329\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Dee_POW_5.6_slice-large.png?resize=1024%2C329&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Dee pictured second from left as part of the WordPress 5.6 contributors\" class=\"wp-image-12957\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Dee_POW_5.6_slice-large.png?resize=1024%2C329&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Dee_POW_5.6_slice-large.png?resize=300%2C96&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Dee_POW_5.6_slice-large.png?resize=768%2C246&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Dee_POW_5.6_slice-large.png?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption>Some of the contributors to the <em>WordPress 5.6 release</em> </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Dee was a coordinator for WordPress 5.6 release in 2020 and was able to encourage others to learn about the process.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Helping others and sharing knowledge through WordPress</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Dee has been an advocate for cross-cultural collaboration and understanding in both WordPress and her work for a large distributed agency which has people from more than 24 countries and operates across 16 timezones.

It’s those connections, it’s the friendships. It’s the network of work, referrals, support, help, encouragement that has kept me wired into this community and committed to helping other people find that connection and growth for themselves.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dee’s career in WordPress has moved through coding, into project management of large scale WordPress projects, and now into delivery leadership. Her connections to community have helped &#8216;fuel the transitions&#8217; through these chapters of her life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She said: “I believe that the place I’ve found and the opportunities I have had owe as much to my own desire and ambition as they do to the help, support and belief of the community around me; sometimes even more than I’ve felt in myself.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She feels that she is ‘living proof’ that by helping, connecting, and resourcing other people, you can be helped, resourced and connected into places you had never thought possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This has enabled her to reach and have a career in technology that she did not know existed as a teenager playing with that first computer mouse and experimenting with code. Dee hopes her story will inspire others in their journey.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"share-the-stories\">Share the stories</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Help share these stories of open source contributors and continue to grow the community. Meet more WordPressers in the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/category/newsletter/interviews/\">People of WordPress series</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Contributors</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks to Abha Thakor (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/webcommsat/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>webcommsat</a>), Meher Bala (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/meher/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>meher</a>), Mary Baum (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/marybaum/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>marybaum</a>), Chloe Bringmann (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/cbringmann/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>cbringmann</a>), Nalini Thakor (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/nalininonstopnewsuk/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>nalininonstopnewsuk</a>), and Larissa Murillo (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/lmurillom/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>lmurillom</a>) for work on this feature.

And welcome to the WordPress Briefing. The podcast where you can catch quick explanations of some of the ideas behind the WordPress open source project and the community around it. As well as get a small list of big things coming up in the next two weeks. I&#8217;m your host Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:00:40]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the approach of various mid-year breaks and the prospect of wandering off for some safe, restorative travel, I&#8217;ve been updating my to-read and re-read list. As I was looking at the queued books for my Northern hemisphere summer, there were some common threads, mostly around leadership, but there&#8217;s also like a chunk that&#8217;s about cross-cultural group theory and economics, and then like some beach reads, but there&#8217;s one group in particular that you all might find interesting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that&#8217;s a group that&#8217;s sort of like a back-to-FOSS basics list. So I&#8217;ll share my top few with you in case you want to pack a copy for your next getaway.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first one on our list is called Producing Open Source Software by Karl Fogel. I think everyone who contributes to FOSS projects has received this as one of their first recommendations. Like, y&#8217;all are building open software? Excellent, you need to read Producing Open Source Software. Like, that is just a sentence that comes out of everyone&#8217;s mouths. So this was one of the first open source books that was recommended to me when I joined the WordPress community. It was freshly revised in 2020, and I haven&#8217;t given it a read since then, which is why it is on my reread list this year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:01:54]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, it shaped the early days of the WordPress project’s leadership, and their lead developers, and some of WordPress&#8217;s basic philosophies. It&#8217;s all available online, under a creative commons, ShareAlike license. And so it&#8217;s worth the read. I&#8217;ll put a link to it in the show notes so it&#8217;s easy for everyone to find in the event that is your preferred beach read.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second one on this list is a book from Nadia Eghbal. She wrote the excellent Roads and Bridges report that also is probably not light beach reading, but you know, this one is on my list to read this summer because Eghbal always delivers truths about the reality of maintaining popular software, popular, open source software, in a way that&#8217;s easy for me to access and process rather than getting paralyzed by the enormity of it all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For what it&#8217;s worth your mileage may vary on that. I realized that, like, I live and breathe open source stuff. And so just because I am not paralyzed by the enormity of her explanations of things doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean that you will have a similar experience. And so I&#8217;m just going to claim that elephant in the room for all of us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, if you only read one book on this list this year, I think that this should be the one that you read.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:03:14]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The third one is called Code: Collaborative Ownership and the Digital Economy. It was edited by Rishab Aiyer Ghosh. I am certain that I butchered that name. And so I apologize on my own behalf to everyone that knows whether or not I said it correctly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This book focuses on intellectual property rights and the original purpose of having anything like copyright in the world. So, right up my alley! The writers who contributed to this work promise exploration of the plight of creativity in the commons, the role of sharing in creative advancement, and a concept of what it would look like if intellectual property were to mean the second closing of an ecosystem versus a triumph of the commons.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I mean, obviously, this one is very light reading. You can take this topic to high tea and everyone will not know what you&#8217;re talking about. However, this one looks like a really interesting book to me and I am just super ready to read it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:04:19]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second to last one on the list is a book called Humble Inquiry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a new-to-me book that seems right in line with one of my favorite books to recommend to leaders in the open source space. From reviews of it, I have gathered that it takes a hard look at the value of listening and asking for clarification in a world that puts a high value on an unsolicited hot take.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It puts the importance of high trust relationship building, which is at the heart of any cross-culturally aware organization. And for folks who&#8217;ve been working with me for a while, you know, that relationship building is an important part of my leadership expectations for myself. So it puts relationship building at the front and center with a promise of practical applications for everyday life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if you ever have tried to tackle a complicated topic like this, you know that practical applications are really hard to come by and it&#8217;s often hard to understand it if you don&#8217;t have those practical applications. And so that is why this one is on my read and reread list this year.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:05:24]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then finally the WordPress Milestones book.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So this sounds like a shameless plug for WordPress. And on the one hand, this whole podcast is about WordPress. And so, yes! But on the other hand, I actually am reading this for two specific reasons. I&#8217;m rereading this actually. I read it when I first joined Automattic. And so the first of the two reasons that I&#8217;m rereading it this year is that volume two of this is, like the second decade of WordPress currently, being researched and written in preparation for WordPress’s 20th birthday next year.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I am rereading this to kind of get that all back in my mind as that work is getting done. And the second reason is that I honestly like to remind myself of how far we&#8217;ve come sometimes. I talk about our work frequently. And I talk about what we&#8217;re working on right now, all the time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I talk about what we&#8217;re looking at three years from now, five years from now. The biggest concerns of today, tomorrow, and the future-future. And it&#8217;s very easy to forget how much success WordPress has had and how much growth the contributors that support us have had over the course of our long and storied history.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:06:40]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so I like to go back to that just to kind of give myself some grounding in our progress, as well as get some concept for how we can move forward together. So that one is also available online. Also under a creative commons ShareAlike license and it is also worth the read. I will share a link to that with the other one in the show notes as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That brings us now to our small list of big things. Let&#8217;s see what we got in the old lineup today.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, firstly WordCamp Europe is happening this week and it&#8217;s possible to watch the live stream from the comfort of your own home. There are some smart and talented speakers at the event. So I encourage you to catch a few if you have the time. I&#8217;ll include a link to the live stream information in the show notes below, and then also you can always keep an eye out on Twitter.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There will be a lot of discussions, a lot of conversation there. And so you can engage with folks that are there at the time and catch up on those conversations, catch up on those presentations in your own time, as it fits into your day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:07:50]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing is that WordPress’s community team is preparing the annual meetup survey right now. So if you participate in meetup events, keep an eye out for that because your feedback helps us to make plans to improve that program so that it works better for you. And it helps you to learn WordPress better and feel more confident with what you are taking out into the world that way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, if you are wanting to use this as a chance to contribute, we actually will need folks who are able to translate the surveys as well. So I&#8217;ll leave a link to some information about that in the show notes. If all of that stuff about contribution didn&#8217;t make any sense, then just like keep an eye out from your meetup organizer and they will make sure that you have that survey so that you can have your voice heard.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:08:33]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then item three is less of an item. I mean, it&#8217;s an item cause it&#8217;s in this list, but it&#8217;s less of, like, a thing to know and more of a general thing to be aware of. It&#8217;s a general awareness item. There&#8217;s a lot going on in WordPress right now. I can see how hard it is to keep track of some of these things these days.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I know as someone who&#8217;s looking at this all day every day that, yeah, it&#8217;s a lot. And it&#8217;s hard to get your bearings. So if you have a team that you contribute to already, don&#8217;t forget to reach out to each other, just to check-in. Sometimes we don&#8217;t think to ask for help. Sometimes we don&#8217;t think to offer help and you know, if no one needs any help from you at that moment, a little hello also can brighten someone&#8217;s day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that, my friends, is your smallest of big things. Thank you for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. And I&#8217;ll see you again in a couple of weeks.</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"12940\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:9;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:63:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n		\n		\n\n					\n										\n					\n		\n		\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:6:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:26:\"WordPress 6.0 “Arturo”\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:42:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2022/05/arturo/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 24 May 2022 20:01:05 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:3:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"Releases\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3:\"6.0\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:2;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"releases\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=12879\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:278:\"Say hello to “Arturo” and WordPress 6.0, inspired by Grammy-winning jazz musician, Arturo O’Farrill.

With thoughtful updates to the writing experience, building better block functionality, and adding a new intuitive style switcher, I’m really proud of the work that’s been done in this release to make a great site editing experience.</p><cite>Josepha Haden Chomphosy, Executive Director</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-container-7 wp-block-buttons\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-button\"><a class=\"wp-block-button__link\" href=\"https://wordpress.org/wordpress-6.0.zip\">Download WordPress 6.0</a></div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h2>What’s Inside</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1204\" height=\"700\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Writing-Improvements-1.png?fit=1204%2C700&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Selecting multiple lines of text from two blocks\" class=\"wp-image-12887\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Writing-Improvements-1.png?w=1204&amp;ssl=1 1204w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Writing-Improvements-1.png?resize=300%2C174&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Writing-Improvements-1.png?resize=1024%2C595&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Writing-Improvements-1.png?resize=768%2C447&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Enhanced Writing Experience</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Writing improvements abound, whether you’re writing a brand new post or adding elements to an existing page. Explore more ways to streamline your content creation process, including:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Select text across multiple blocks for easier copying and pasting.</li><li>Type two open brackets `<code>[[</code>` to quickly access a list of recent posts and pages.</li><li>Keep existing styles when you transform some blocks from one kind to another—from a Paragraph block to a Code block, for instance.</li><li>Create customized buttons and any new buttons you make will retain the style customizations automatically.</li><li>Make tag clouds and social icons even more appealing with updated settings and controls, and a new outline style for the tag cloud.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1204\" height=\"700\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Style-switcher-big.gif?fit=1204%2C700&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Style variations of Twenty Twenty Two theme\" class=\"wp-image-12893\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Style Switching&nbsp;</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Block themes now include the option to contain multiple style variations. This expands the new Style system even further and enables shortcuts to switch the look and feel of your site all within a single theme. In block themes that support this feature, you can change both the available settings, like the font-weight, and the style options, like the default color palette. Change the look and feel of your site with just a few clicks.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1204\" height=\"700\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Expanded-templates.png?fit=1204%2C700&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Popover listing available templates\" class=\"wp-image-12889\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Expanded-templates.png?w=1204&amp;ssl=1 1204w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Expanded-templates.png?resize=300%2C174&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Expanded-templates.png?resize=1024%2C595&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Expanded-templates.png?resize=768%2C447&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>More Template Choices</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 6.0 includes five new template options for block themes: author, date, categories, tag, and taxonomy. These additional templates provide greater flexibility for content creators. Tailor each with the tools you already know or with the following new options in this release:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Featured images can be used in the cover block.</li><li>New featured image sizing controls make it easier to get the results you want.</li><li>While editing a template, at the root, or between blocks, the quick inserter shows you patterns and template parts to help you work faster and discover new layout options.</li><li>The query block supports filtering on multiple authors, support for custom taxonomies, and support for customizing what is shown when there are no results.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1204\" height=\"700\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Integrated-Patterns.png?fit=1204%2C700&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Browsing footer patterns in the quick inserter\" class=\"wp-image-12890\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Integrated-Patterns.png?w=1204&amp;ssl=1 1204w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Integrated-Patterns.png?resize=300%2C174&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Integrated-Patterns.png?resize=1024%2C595&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Integrated-Patterns.png?resize=768%2C447&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Integrated Patterns</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Patterns will now appear when you need them in even more places, like in the quick inserter or when creating a new header or footer. If you’re a block theme author, you can even <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/block-api/block-patterns/\">register patterns from the Pattern Directory using `<code>theme.json</code>`</a>, enabling you to prioritize specific patterns that are most helpful to your theme’s users.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Additional Design Tools</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Design tools grow more powerful and intuitive with each release. Some highlights for 6.0 include:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>A new color panel design saves space, but still shows your options at a glance.&nbsp;</li><li>New border controls offer a simpler way to set your border exactly as you like it.&nbsp;</li><li>Transparency levels for your colors allow for even more creative color options.</li><li>Control gaps, margins, typography, and more on a collection of blocks, all at once, in the Group block.</li><li>Switch between stack, row, and group variations to position groups of blocks with more layout flexibility.</li><li>Use the gap support functionality in the Gallery block to create different looks – from adding spacing between all images, to removing spacing altogether.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1204\" height=\"700\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/List-view.png?fit=1204%2C700&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Selecting multiple blocks in the list view\" class=\"wp-image-12891\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/List-view.png?w=1204&amp;ssl=1 1204w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/List-view.png?resize=300%2C174&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/List-view.png?resize=1024%2C595&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/List-view.png?resize=768%2C447&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Better List View</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>New keyboard shortcuts enable you to select multiple blocks from the list view, modify them in bulk, and drag and drop them within the list. List View can be opened and closed easily; it comes collapsed by default and it automatically expands to the current selection whenever you select a block.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1204\" height=\"700\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Block-Locking-Controls.png?fit=1204%2C700&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Unlocking the block in the block toolbar\" class=\"wp-image-12892\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Block-Locking-Controls.png?w=1204&amp;ssl=1 1204w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Block-Locking-Controls.png?resize=300%2C174&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Block-Locking-Controls.png?resize=1024%2C595&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Block-Locking-Controls.png?resize=768%2C447&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Block Locking Controls</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Now you can lock your blocks. Choose to disable the option to move a block, remove a block, or both. This simplifies project handover, allowing your clients to unleash their creativity without worrying about accidentally breaking their site in the process.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Improved Performance in WordPress 6.0</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This release includes several updates focused on improving the performance of WordPress.

If you find compatibility problems, please be sure to post detailed information to the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/forum/alphabeta/\">support forums</a>, so these items can be investigated further prior to the final release date of May 24.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Review the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/05/03/wordpress-6-0-field-guide/\"><em>WordPress 6.0 Field Guide</em></a>, for more details on this release.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Review additional information on the full <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/6-0/\">6.0 release cycle</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Check the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/\">Make WordPress Core blog</a> for <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/tag/dev-notes+6-0/\">6.0-related developer notes</a> in the coming weeks which will detail upcoming changes.</p>\n\n\n\n<h1>Translate WordPress</h1>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you speak a language other than English? <a href=\"https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp/dev\">Help translate WordPress into more than 100 languages.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h1>How to Help Test WordPress</h1>\n\n\n\n<p>Testing for issues is critical for stabilizing a release throughout its development.

And welcome to the WordPress Briefing. The podcast where you can catch quick explanations of the ideas behind the WordPress open source project, some insight into the community that supports it, and get a small list of big things coming up in the next two weeks. I&#8217;m your host Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:00:40]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Y&#8217;all, we&#8217;ve got an absolutely jam-packed couple of weeks in WordPress. We&#8217;ve got events happening and releases shipping and contributor days being coordinated (I almost said contributor days being contributed). That&#8217;s also what they&#8217;re doing. I&#8217;ll share some of those highlights in today&#8217;s small list of big things, but I did want to specifically call out something that&#8217;s coming up this week on Thursday (May 19, 2022), and that something is Global Accessibility Awareness Day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The team of contributors over on the Accessibility team has participated in the Global Accessibility Awareness Day in the past. So I thought it would be interesting to hear from one of the co-founders of this particular day of awareness.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:01:27]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All right. And with that, Joe Devin, would you like to tell us a little bit more about yourself?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:01:34] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sure. So I am the co-founder of Global Accessibility Awareness Day, which is a day that goes viral every year on the third Thursday of May. We typically have the Twitter reach on the GAAD hashtag on Twitter of 200 million users, which is, I think, pretty much their active user count. We stopped counting once we hit their daily active user count. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then, I am Chair of the GAAD Foundation, which we launched last year. And then I have a day job too, where I&#8217;m CEO and co-founder of Diamond, which is an inclusive digital agency that builds software accessibly by default. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:02:15]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wonderful. Well, we are so excited to have you today. I said we like it&#8217;s me and the mouse in my pocket—we in the WordPress community that&#8217;s going to listen to this. Super excited to have you today. So you mentioned GAAD, Global Accessibility Awareness Day. Last year was your 10th anniversary, which is very exciting, but like with so many good things, I hear it all started with a blog post and a blog post on WordPress, no less.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I&#8217;d love to hear about how GAAD evolved from that, with, as I understand it, your co-founder of Jennison (Asuncion). That must be where you met him, I assume.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:02:51] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes. Yes. So what happened was I started a WordPress blog called <em>My SQL Talk</em>. So it&#8217;s a database blog, and I just thought it was a brilliant name. I mean, My SQL Talk, like that, should be super popular.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it probably had maybe ten people who ever looked. Um, and then my dad was getting older, and my dad was a survivor of the concentration camps, and he was a genius. He spoke ten languages. It, he was one of those people. That, when he walked into a room, he just commanded respect. You knew that there was history. I don&#8217;t know how to explain it really, but it was special when my dad walked into the room. And considering all of this that he suffered in his life, watching him get older and struggle, particularly with his banking, was very painful to see. And the bank wasn&#8217;t accessible, so I wrote this blog post proposing that we create a Global Accessibility Awareness Day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes I get these visions, and they never turn into anything. But while I think about it, I&#8217;m like, &#8220;all right, let&#8217;s write this blog post and this can definitely work. Right?&#8221; And then you finish the blog post to hit send, and you&#8217;re like, &#8220;this is not going to work.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I wasn&#8217;t even smart enough to do social media on it. But fortunately, WordPress had an auto-tweet feature, and it tweeted it out, and Jennison Asuncion, my co-founder, happened to be around and not out that Saturday night. And he read the blog post, and he said, &#8220;this is a great idea. Let&#8217;s make it happen.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And we had two busy people, but we both had a community. He had the accessibility community, and I was building a tech scene in Los Angeles. And what I discovered is if you combine a great idea with the community, great things can happen. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:04:49]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh man, you&#8217;re speaking my language over here, helping people find their communities, knowing that community is the thing that is the lifeblood of society.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That sounded like a tautology. It is not a tautology. You can have a society with an attempt to not have any sort of community around it, but I bet it doesn&#8217;t work very well. Well, that&#8217;s, that&#8217;s very interesting. And so you all just kind of talked through what that would look like, I assume in confidence, or that would have to take place, right? Or was it on Twitter in those days?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:05:24]</strong> </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, you could still look in the comments and see the back and forth of Jennison and a bunch of other people that got pretty involved with GAAD that are some legendary folks in there. It&#8217;s kind of mind-blowing because I dunno how, how you feel, but for me, when I used to code, uh, three months later, I&#8217;d look back at old code and be like, &#8220;oh, I suck,&#8221; you know, or write an email even and you look back on it a day later and are like &#8220;what a stupid email, how stupid am I?&#8221; You know?  But I look back on that one after ten years; I was scared to look at it because I&#8217;m like, it must&#8217;ve been really bad. But you know, it kind of held up, and exactly what I wrote in there happened &#8211; to my utter shock.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:06:06]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>But also, it&#8217;s kinda nice, though, to look back and be like, &#8220;oh, I used to be much dumber.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cause then you&#8217;re like, look how far I&#8217;ve come. I&#8217;m no longer that dumb. I&#8217;m a different kind of dumb now; good for me. I always hope to be a different kind of dumb as I go forward. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So then, okay, so that was your ten-year anniversary last year. GAAD, in general, now has been going on for 11 years, and at the time of this recording, in a couple of weeks, but then probably a week when it finally publishes, you have your next, your next round of that going.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think it seems safe to assume that awareness of the need for accessibility has increased during that time, but we all know that the work of accessibility is ongoing. And so, I&#8217;m just curious to hear from your perspective if the awareness of the need for accessibility has generally started to permeate developer communities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And are you seeing more developer awareness around the need for accessibility in tech in general?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:07:12]</strong> </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. You know, it&#8217;s not enough. It&#8217;s certainly improved a lot.  I keynoted a conference probably four years after GAAD started, maybe five, and I kind of assumed nobody would have heard of accessibility, and I was taken aback when I asked who had heard of it, and a good chunk of the room had. So even then, there had been a difference, and I&#8217;d say now I see accessibility mentioned a lot more in conferences and stuff. But when it comes to actually building it, there&#8217;s a tremendous amount of ignorance. There, there still needs to be a lot more awareness.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think partially people are a little bit scared to dip their toe because they&#8217;re scared that they&#8217;re going to be told that &#8220;no, it&#8217;s not accessible,&#8221; or that they&#8217;re going to say the wrong word or offend somebody. So I&#8217;d say that there&#8217;s some degree of trepidation, but also developers, and it&#8217;s not just developers, designers, and product people. There&#8217;s so much to learn, and it&#8217;s like, &#8220;oh God, there&#8217;s another piece that I have to learn.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I&#8217;m so glad that you invited me on this podcast because it&#8217;s the developers that, you know, I am a developer, not anymore, I haven&#8217;t touched code in years, but that&#8217;s where I came from. Right? This is my peach, right? Particularly WordPress folks, because I had done a fair bit of WordPress before I moved on to some other things. And, I think we have to talk about usability and understand that accessibility is so much more than how we look at disability.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if you don&#8217;t mind, I&#8217;m going to ask you a question. How do you think the typical WordPress developer or designer would define disability? </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:09:05] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>in the kinds of conversations that I&#8217;ve had over the years, it frequently has to do with visual things. Because it&#8217;s just screens all day, right? And that&#8217;s a primary area where our designers and developers really have made some effort.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But my personal favorite sort of, of example, for like, when you&#8217;re looking at how to make sure that your products are accessible is, what, if you have to use your website, or you have to build your website using only one arm. Because that gives you an opportunity to kind of look at disability from a permanent standpoint.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like if you have lost permanent use of one arm, but also gives you an opportunity to look at the temporary options for that sort of lack of mobility. Like you&#8217;re a mother with an infant, and so you have to be able to, you know, get your stuff done with one arm. And so I know that we paid a bunch of attention to screen readers and what works in not way back in 2018 and 2019 did a lot of work with. Literally zero screen. And can you still do the thing that you need to do, which was incredibly difficult. And I was really excited to see what our developers came up with around that. But I think that that is quite a bit of that discussion as we&#8217;re going through it from the beginning to the&nbsp;end.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:10:27] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. I mean, that&#8217;s a great answer, and you definitely understand some of the nuances way better than I think that the average creator, digital product creator, I&#8217;m including the, you know, the product people, the designers, and the developers.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:10:42] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;re very fortunate to have more than just developers in WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:10:50]  </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The reason I bring this up is that the WHO (World Health Organization) had to; they&#8217;re the ones that did massive research across the globe. And they had to, they had to come up with a definition, and in their definition, they needed to draw a line. Typically, I don&#8217;t remember the exact thing cause it&#8217;s a 350-page report, and I kept looking for where they defined it again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was a little hard to find, but essentially it&#8217;s if there&#8217;s a major disability or a disability that impacts some significant portion of your day-to-day activities. And that&#8217;s really great when you&#8217;re trying to do a report on how many disabilities there are out there; what percentage of the population has a disability?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And their figures are something like 15% of the population has a disability, which is a huge number. But at the same time, they also mentioned that 2.2 billion people have a visual impairment. And we also know that over 33% of the population is over 50, and I&#8217;m included in that population. And I can say that when you&#8217;re over 50, you know, I&#8217;ve got clouds in my eyes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t know where they came from, but they definitely make it harder to see. When I&#8217;m in a restaurant, I can&#8217;t focus on the person across from me the same way. My hearing is not the same, and anybody over 50 is going to have certain impairments and won&#8217;t see as well; color contrast issues are a big deal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Being able to raise the font is a big deal. And I think that accessibility is connected in most people&#8217;s minds with disability. And they&#8217;ll attach that to something like being blind or being deaf or hard of hearing or having a missing limb or having some other kind of disability. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, as a result, they&#8217;re like, &#8220;well, I don&#8217;t even know any people in that category possibly,&#8221; and as a result, they&#8217;re like, &#8220;well, how important is this?&#8221; Yes. They might feel guilty. I should do the right thing. This is the right thing to do. But honestly, like how much money should I spend on it? How much, what percentage of my time should I spend on it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it&#8217;s because they don&#8217;t realize that everybody has different abilities. And so, I&#8217;m starting to go away from even talking about disabilities and asking people to remember that all of us perceive things differently. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you remember the gold dress where they were trying to say, what color is this dress? Is it gold and white or blue and black? And it is blue and black, but to me, all I see is gold and white. And then there was Laurel or Yanny. Do you remember that?. And some people heard it, and typically older people heard it as Laurel, and I&#8217;ve, and I do this in some of my presentations. I play that, that sound. And usually, it&#8217;s Laurel for me, but sometimes it&#8217;s Yanny. Even personally, it changes. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so, we have a totally different perception. Now think about memory. There&#8217;s a different kind of blindness. If you try and remember, let&#8217;s say a relative or a friend that is no longer. How well do you see that picture?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because for me, it is very, very vague, but for some people, they say, and I&#8217;ve been asking people, and I&#8217;d love your answer as well. How vivid is it? And some people say, I can read the, I can see the pattern on the shirt. It&#8217;s as vivid as if I see with opening my eyes, seeing, you know, the regular in front of me, and I can even read a name tag in the memory.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I&#8217;m like, Woah, so maybe I&#8217;m blind in a way. Right? So how do you see it? How do you remember things?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:14:42] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, I&#8217;m a, I&#8217;m a real visual person and a tactile person. And so, like if I interacted with someone, I&#8217;m very likely to be able to picture, like, recreate that mental picture pretty well in my mind. I recently, very recently, met some of my first people in that executive leadership space who were like, yeah, I don&#8217;t, I don&#8217;t visualize things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I was like, what are you, how do you do this work? Because like, you have to be able to do that. And they were like, no, I don&#8217;t have mental pictures.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:15:13] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some people don&#8217;t have an inner dialogue.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:15:17] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t understand that either,&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:15:19] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Me either. So accessibility studies all of these differences with respect to how you&#8217;re presenting all of this information.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if you don&#8217;t pay attention to accessibility, you&#8217;re really just missing out. And then there&#8217;s colorblindness. If you&#8217;re creating something like slack that has an online/offline indicator, and you only use red and green for people who are colorblind, they see gray and gray. And so what I&#8217;m trying to teach the community with digital product creators is that no, you cannot ignore it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can ignore accessibility, but then you&#8217;re not good at your job. I mean, I don&#8217;t mean to say it in an offensive way, but you&#8217;re not good at your job if you&#8217;re unaware. If you break a rule on purpose, great. But if you don&#8217;t know the rule, it&#8217;s just a lack of craft, and you absolutely should make it a priority.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And you&#8217;re not doing it as a charity. You&#8217;re doing it because you care about your users, and you care about your craft, and you want to build things well, and it&#8217;s a necessity. And I think that this is the kind of message that our community needs to hear.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:16:31]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I want to touch on something that you sort of brought up a bit, um, at the start of the answer there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you brought up the concept of usability. And in the last time that I did a podcast about accessibility, I defined accessibility as a subset of usability. Do you think that if we were to consistently draw that line for people so that it&#8217;s not just like accessibility is this thing that you should do outside of usability?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If we were to more consistently draw that line, do you think that that would help people to see and understand better that its shades of existence, usability, and accessibility?  &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:17:10] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, 100%, a hundred percent. And in my company, we kind of realized that that&#8217;s exactly what we have to do. We have to see this as usability.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I don&#8217;t, we talk about accessibility a lot, but I don&#8217;t want to. It&#8217;s part of the plumbing for us. We&#8217;ve made it part of the plumbing, and I can tell you it&#8217;s a struggle to take accessibility and make it part of an organization, even when you&#8217;re bringing it top-down, believe it or not. For our teams, particularly the designers, they are blown away by what they&#8217;re learning because they&#8217;re improving their craft.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And design is typically where there&#8217;s a struggle to get accessibility accepted because there seems to be a very strong idea of what a design should look like. And I think it&#8217;s really about the approach because UX and design it&#8217;s all about empathy for people. And when you approach it, not as, even though empathy should mean that, that, you know, do the right thing at the same time, it&#8217;s more about empathy for your user, and your user includes so much more than just people with disabilities that you haven&#8217;t run into somebody that has that disability and therefore you build it better, and it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s completely blown their mind. They love it. They love doing it. And I&#8217;m not hiring people with accessibility coming in. We&#8217;re training them to work accessibly. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:18:34] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I think it&#8217;s interesting that you talk about empathy as part of being able to make sure that you&#8217;re creating something that&#8217;s accessible because I actually feel like empathy is. Like it&#8217;s being considered this gold standard for many, many things right now. And I think it actually is more harmful in the long run than instead making altruistic choices.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so, I have a blog post that I will link in our show notes that will kind of help everybody see more fully my concept there. But when you rely on empathy, you do kind of have to rely on one, being able to run into all of the issues you were mentioning. You have to know people who have problems in order to know that the problems exist.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then you also kind of have to assume that once you have willingly put yourself into the discomfort of that kind of disability, whatever, wherever it exists on that spectrum, your experience of that discomfort is the same as someone who lives with it. And I just don&#8217;t think that we can necessarily do that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I always think that trying to do the altruistic thing, like doing your research and figuring out what it is and trying to make decisions on behalf of other people as best you can, which is a terrible thing. Still, like decisions that take into account the experiences that people are sharing with you and then going to them and saying, &#8220;does this make that experience better or worse?&#8221; is the more sustainable option from my perspective, this is specifically leadership. Still, I think it&#8217;s true for accessibility as well, and probably product design as a whole, but it&#8217;s very difficult. Like people really feel like they understand the concept of empathy right now. And I do think that sometimes that leads us down the wrong path for things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What&#8217;s your thought on that? I think you kind of agree based on what your answer was&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:20:33]</strong> </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, no, absolutely. And you know, we, you, can&#8217;t never about us without us, as the common saying, and we&#8217;ve gathered a group of a hundred people with a wide variety of disabilities for research. Whenever we do any UX and research, and sometimes we&#8217;re asked to just do research projects, we go out and ask the users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We had some really interesting companies approach us to do innovation and accessibility, and they had strong assumptions. We looked at the assumptions and agreed with it, but we&#8217;re like, all right, they were smart. They said, &#8220;vet this with users for us, please,&#8221; because they didn&#8217;t want to gather their own group.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We vetted with users, and we&#8217;re blown away, always blown away because there are so many things you just don&#8217;t know unless you&#8217;ve lived with a particular disability. You can&#8217;t guess, and you&#8217;ve got to speak to your users and a wide variety of them. &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:21:30]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, absolutely. Absolutely. What role does open source play in expanding accessibility, either in specifically the digital space or just accessibility in general?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:21:42] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I guess if the question is, what role does it play? I would say the role it plays is it is, unfortunately, it makes accessibility worse because, for the most part open source is not very accessible. And it&#8217;s a personal passion of mine, so I&#8217;m really glad that you brought that up. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, it is so bizarre. You write a blog post and then it goes viral, and it goes viral every year to a degree that you can&#8217;t even believe it, that all these companies that you know are running events. Privately, publicly talking about it. And then you get all these people thanking you for what you&#8217;ve done year after year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then one year, you read on Twitter, The Blind Onion; I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;re familiar with The Onion, the satirical clip, there&#8217;s the Blind Onion. And they tweet out, &#8220;Now that Global Accessibility Awareness Day is over, we look forward to 364 days of global accessibility oblivion.&#8221; And that really hurt at the time, but at the same time, and I was told to ignore it, don&#8217;t worry about it, but I&#8217;m like, no, this is coming from a place of pain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the point of GAAD was to make a difference. It wasn&#8217;t too to just give everybody an opportunity to say, &#8220;Hey, look at what we&#8217;re doing,&#8221; and then not make a difference. So, as a result of that, I started to think about, well, where are we with this? And, and so I&#8217;ve created a state of accessibility report that through my company, we&#8217;re able to run for a few years, and it&#8217;s not, you know, the state is not great.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I&#8217;m like, well, what can we do to change things? So, as a result of all of this, I really wanted to figure out, well, what can we do to make sure that GAAD does make a difference? And so, I came up with the idea of the GAAD pledge, which is specifically meant for open source frameworks. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the idea of the GAAD pledge is that an open source framework, when they are ready, takes the pledge to make accessibility a core value of the framework. Now, terms of what that actually entails are different for every single project because every project is unique. We did create a bit of a framework, which had the idea of saying, okay, you&#8217;re going to, first of all, create an accessibility statement that says that this framework is going to conform to whatever, WCAG, which is Web Content Accessibility Guidelines, to whatever WCAG level is decided and is appropriate for the framework. That there&#8217;s going to be documentation for anybody that is downloading this piece of open source project and trying to implement it, that there should be guidelines for them, that all of the examples should be accessible. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s really important because even the frameworks that try to pay attention to accessibility. You&#8217;ll often see that people from the community will provide examples, and they&#8217;re inaccessible. And it&#8217;s really sad when you see that because so many people are just copy-pasting. That&#8217;s typically how it works, and they&#8217;re going to copy-paste something bad. So putting a statement around it, I think, would be really great.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And what we&#8217;re hoping to see is that lots and lots of big open source communities decide to take the pledge. And then it&#8217;ll sort of be table stakes that any new open source projects as well look, all of these frameworks that made it, they took the pledge and therefore we should take the pledge as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so the very first year, we had React Native take the pledge, and they put a lot of effort into their accessibility. The second group to take it was Ember.js, and they always put a lot of effort into their accessibility, and they continued that effort. We&#8217;re about to announce the next one, but we&#8217;re still two weeks away.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I can&#8217;t say anything yet, but yeah, we&#8217;re, uh, we&#8217;re hoping for a lot more uptake on, on the gap pledge because it, it affects so many people downstream. WordPress&#8217;s what percent of the web right now? 43%? So there you go. That&#8217;s so many people.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:25:57] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So many people. Yeah, fun fact Gutenberg, our current rewriting of the editing experience in WordPress, primarily uses React. And so, I&#8217;m glad to hear that they have taken that pledge as well. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As with any good cooking, it starts with good&nbsp;ingredients.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:26:12] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>You said it. That was great. I wish I was a cook, though.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:26:23] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I love it. All right. Let&#8217;s what keeps you up at night when it comes to the state of accessibility?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:26:29] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>What keeps me up at night is how to move the needle. It is such a big thing to change. And there are so many angles that you can approach this with, but at the end of the day, it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s a monster.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s a monster. There are so many legacy sites out there. If you look at WebAIM, they do a yearly report on the state of accessibility as well. They call it the WebAIM Million, and they&#8217;re typically seeing 97% inaccessible, 98%. It goes up and down a little bit every year. And that&#8217;s, that&#8217;s just a huge boat to move.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think we need to at least get the newer, uh, newer websites and mobile apps to move. And what we&#8217;ve seen in our state of accessibility report is that only the very top companies seem to put in the effort to make their products accessible. There is a big push with the enterprise companies to do it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The CEOs are starting to talk about it, but what we need is the entire culture of software development to change. Or I should even say digital product development change and to move that boat is massive. And that&#8217;s I put it in my tagline in my email like that&#8217;s my mission in life, and I hope to achieve it before I die.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that keeps me up at night.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:27:52] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think that would keep me up at night as well. I mean, it seems like you are really just personally mission-driven and impact-driven. Do you feel like, in the event that the work that you&#8217;ve accomplished so far is what you accomplish, you feel still like you&#8217;ve had an impact?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I feel like you have had&nbsp;an impact. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:28:13] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m not one of those people that tries to have a legacy or like tries to focus on what my impact is and all of that. I just try and do good work. And hopefully, it just shows at the end of the day. I&#8217;m just trying to have the impact without the accolades.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:28:34]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I get it. Well, Joe, thank you so much for joining us here on this episode of WP Briefing. You have been a delight to chat with.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:28:42]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Likewise, it&#8217;s really been a pleasure to meet you, and uh, and I appreciate the opportunity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:28:54] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And now it&#8217;s time for our smallest of big things. As I mentioned at the start, it is packed. Number one tomorrow, May 17th, RC3. So one of the final RCs that we&#8217;re going to have for the WordPress 6.0 release, unless something goes horribly, horribly wrong, which I don&#8217;t think it will. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then, two days after that, Global Accessibility Awareness Day, as I mentioned, will be on May 19th. So, this coming Thursday. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then next week, we have the 6.0 release. We have the WordPress 6.0 release on May 24th. </p>\n\n\n\n<p> Three days after that, WordPress turns 19 on May 27th, starting its final teenage year before we turn twenty in 2023. So that was the rapid-fire dance card for the next two weeks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The stuff that is happening with and around WordPress for everyone to know. As a heads up, also, many people are headed to WordCamp Europe in Porto(, Portugal). The first week of June, I am going to do a live from WordCamp Europe episode. It will not be live. I&#8217;ll just record it live. And so. You know you&#8217;ll get to hear me with my hoarsest voice and maybe singing to my computer. Cause that almost always happens at these things. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that, my friends, is your small list of big things. Thank you for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. And I&#8217;ll see you again in a couple of weeks.</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"12855\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:12;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:69:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n\n					\n										\n					\n		\n		\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:6:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:65:\"WordPress 6.0 Release Candidate 2 (RC2) Now Available for Testing\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:99:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2022/05/wordpress-6-0-release-candidate-2-rc2-now-available-for-testing/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 10 May 2022 18:06:09 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:5:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:11:\"Development\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"Releases\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:2;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3:\"6.0\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:3;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:11:\"development\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:4;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"releases\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=12840\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:171:\"WordPress 6.0 Release Candidate 2 is now available for testing!

Before the official release date, time is set aside for the community to perform final reviews and help test. Since the WordPress ecosystem includes thousands of plugins and themes, it is important that everyone within the WordPress community check to see if anything was missed along the way. That means the project would love your help.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 6.0 is planned for official release on May 24th, 2022, three weeks from today.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>This version of the WordPress software is under development</strong>. Please do not install, run, and test this version of WordPress on a production or mission-critical website. Instead, it is recommended that you RC1 on a test server and site.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can test WordPress 6.0 RC1 in three ways:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Option 1: </strong>Install and activate the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/\">WordPress Beta Tester</a> plugin (select the “Bleeding edge” channel and “Beta/RC Only” stream).</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Option 2: </strong>Direct download the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/wordpress-6.0-RC1.zip\">release candidate version here (zip)</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Option 3:</strong> When using WP-CLI to upgrade from Beta 1, 2, 3, or 4, on a case-insensitive filesystem, please use the following command:<br><code>wp core update --version=6.0-RC1</code></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additional information on the full <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/6-0/\">6.0 release cycle is available here</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Check the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/\">Make WordPress Core blog</a> for <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/tag/dev-notes+6-0/\">6.0-related developer notes</a> in the coming weeks which will detail all upcoming changes.</p>\n\n\n\n<h1>What’s in WordPress 6.0 RC1?</h1>\n\n\n\n<p>Since Beta 4, various items have been addressed, including (but not limited to):&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Backport updates of Comment blocks tests (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/55643\">#55643</a>)</li><li>Backport a bugfix of Comment Template block pagination (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/55658\">#55658</a>)</li><li>Editor: Backport bug fixes for WordPress 6.0 from Gutenberg (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/55567\">#55567</a>)</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 6.0 is the second major release for 2022, following 5.9 which became generally available in January. This release includes nearly 1,000 fixes and enhancements spanning most areas of the WordPress platform. Some key highlights within the content creation and site-building feature sets include:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Style Switching:</strong> <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/03/03/core-editor-improvement-choose-your-style/\">switch up the look and feel of your site</a>, all in one block theme. No need to change themes!</li><li><strong>More template options:</strong> use blocks to edit five more templates (author, date, categories, tag, and taxonomy).</li><li><strong>Multi-select: </strong>Easily select text across multiple blocks. Edit to your liking.</li><li><strong>Retain Styles: </strong>Keep your custom styles in place, whether transforming between blocks or creating new buttons.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>More patterns in more places:</strong> the Quick Inserter surfaces patterns that might work well for the condition you’re in, baking in relevant patterns for template parts and pages you’re working on.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>List View improvements: </strong>New keyboard shortcuts (shift + click) let you select multiple blocks to modify in bulk (reposition, delete, etc.), see your content at a glance with a collapsed by default view, and more.</li><li><strong>Refined design tools: </strong>Explore<strong> </strong>a new color panel, transparency options, more group block variations to create new layout options (Stack, Row), the ability to set your featured image in a Cover block, control the exact size of your featured image, gap support for the Gallery block, and more.</li><li><strong>New blocks: </strong>Various Post Comments, Read More, No Results in Query Loop, Post Author Biography, Avatar blocks.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Block Locking: </strong>Choose to disable the option to remove a block, move it, or both, right in the editor.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Export block themes: </strong>Explore the improved block theme export tool, as WordPress heads closer to codeless visual block theme building.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h1>Plugin and Theme Developers</h1>\n\n\n\n<p>All plugin and theme developers should test their respective extensions against WordPress 6.0 RC1 and update the “<em>Tested up to”</em> version in their readme file to 6.0. If you find compatibility problems, please be sure to post detailed information to the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/forum/alphabeta/\">support forums</a>, so these items can be investigated further prior to the final release date of May 24th.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Review the <em><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/05/03/wordpress-6-0-field-guide/\">WordPress 6.0 Field Guide</a></em>, for more details on what’s contained in this release.</p>\n\n\n\n<h1>Translate WordPress</h1>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you speak a language other than English? <a href=\"https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp/dev\">Help translate WordPress into more than 100 languages.</a> This release also marks the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/handbook/glossary/#hard-freeze\">hard string freeze</a> point of the 6.0 release cycle.</p>\n\n\n\n<h1>How to Help Test WordPress</h1>\n\n\n\n<p>Testing for issues is critical for stabilizing a release throughout its development. Testing is also a great way to contribute to WordPress.

I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:00:40]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tomorrow&#8217;s a big day. It marks the beginning of what is called the RC period, or release candidate period, for the current major release of the WordPress CMS. If you&#8217;re not super familiar with the way release cycles work, this is the point in the process where the code should pretty much be done changing.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That way you can call in your designers, developers, and anyone else who builds things for others using your software. And they can either start testing their products on it, or they can figure out what new things they need to be able to teach their clients, whichever is most relevant to them. That is generally true for WordPress as well, but in true open source fashion, there is a caveat built in that helps us to get in last-minute, vital changes from contributors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have a two-person sign-off rule that&#8217;s been around for about as long as I can remember, but lets things be added late in the release cycle, as long as there are two sign-offs from qualified contributors. Most of the time, those qualified contributors are lead developers of the project, but not always. We have a good group of people who are around helping us make sure that this is doable and the best thing that we can offer to all of our users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:01:50]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so, yeah, two-person sign-off, that is the little bit of release process trivia that you never knew you needed. And since we&#8217;re looking at a release trivia, kind of hidden bits of how software is made, I actually have a guest with me today, Channing Ritter. So Channing is a product and visual designer based in Brooklyn, New York.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She&#8217;s a design director at Automattic and has been working on the WordPress project as a full-time sponsored contributor since January, 2021. She is joining us to share some behind the scenes intel on what&#8217;s going into the 6.0 release, her role in that process, and then we&#8217;ll just kind of see how the conversation goes from there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:02:40]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, and with that, I&#8217;d like to welcome Channing to the WordPress Briefing. Hi Channing!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter </strong>00:02:45]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hey Josepha. Thanks so much for having me.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:02:48] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m excited to have you here. If I understand, you are working on the design side of things with the release. So why don&#8217;t you tell me a little bit about the role you&#8217;ve played?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong> 00:02:59] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am. I am the design release lead for the 6.0 release. And if I understand correctly, this is a position that has been unfulfilled for the past few release cycles. So I&#8217;m kind of the first person to step in over the past few releases. And I think that&#8217;s really exciting, especially because design has started to play such a more important role in the WordPress project over the past few years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it makes sense that design would have a seat at the table, and I&#8217;m really excited to be helping advocate for the design team and learning from other folks on the release squad. Who&#8217;ve been doing this for a while.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:03:33] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So. First big question about 6.0, what is the feature that you are most excited about?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong> 00:03:39] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m most excited about the style switcher within the global styles panel. Um, so if folks still don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;m talking about there, it&#8217;s the ability to change between different variations of the theme.json without actually switching the theme.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So this is a way to get a drastically different look and feels across your site with just a single click. And I see it as a really fun place to experiment and kind of get inspired for the different ways your site could appear without ever having to change your theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And in terms of the Twenty Twenty-Two variations, they&#8217;re just really gorgeous and all so diverse. Like you have the main default theme that has the deep green and kind of peachy colors and this really elegant type treatment with a really thin Serif typeface. But then the variations are so different from that. And I think my favorite one is the Swiss variation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:04:36]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Swiss variation?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong> 00:04:38]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, every graphic design nerd loves Swiss design.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:04:42] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, ok! Now I know!&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong> 00:04:38] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Really awesome things found in there. It&#8217;s a really high contrast, bold variation. It&#8217;s kind of black and white with red accents. I just love how different it is from the default style and how easy it is to change up your site and just get a whole drastically different look and feel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:05:00] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s excellent. So for folks who do not know what we&#8217;re referring to, when we talk about the Twenty Twenty-Two variation, that is the default theme, Twenty Twenty-Two. I&#8217;ll put a link to both the classic and block-based versions in our show notes, but you&#8217;ll want to use the block-based version to look at these style variations that Channing has mentioned here.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong> 00:05:24] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, we&#8217;re really excited that the first-ever default block theme was released with 5.9, which is when Twenty Twenty-Two first went out and was bundled with 5.9.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But now, with 6.0, I think even more so it&#8217;s starting to showcase the real power of block themes and what can actually be done there. And style variations is a huge kind of first step into this new world of block themes and starting to really open up the possibilities and all the flexibility that you have there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:05:55] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, absolutely. So when we&#8217;re talking about the Twenty Twenty-Two default theme, when we&#8217;re talking about switching these variations inside the theme itself, that seems to me to be a very user-focused kind of feature. And when we talk about users in WordPress, there&#8217;s a lot of room for interpretation. Like if we look at it kind of in a framework of three types of users of WordPress, you have, like end-users. So people who are site owners using it as a site to, like, enable their business.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But you also have mid-end users—people who use it to build sites for others. And what I like to call back-end users, people who are using WordPress as a framework. And of course at the start of the Gutenberg project, way back in forever, a million years ago, one of the big calls to action that we had around even, like, trying to do this, was that we wanted to make WordPress easier for users. Just plain users.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, and to me, that means making WordPress easier for those mid-end users, people who are creating WordPress sites for other people. But also should give some power and autonomy back to those end-users, the people who are using sites to enable their business or are site owners.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:07:14] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so in that context, between 5.9 and 6.0, do you feel like we have features that are really giving that kind of power and agency back to our end-users? Do you feel like we have some features that are really focused on those mid-end users, as opposed to our backend users? For a long time, we focused heavily on enabling our backend users, and now Gutenberg kind of moves us into those other two areas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so do you think that things like being able to switch between your style of variations, other things like that are moving us closer to that particular goal of Gutenberg?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong> 00:07:51] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s a great question. I think it&#8217;s both. I think some of the features being released in 6.0 are absolutely going to empower that end-user.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Particularly in terms of improvements around design tools and some of the quality of life improvements. For example, partially selecting across multiple blocks and being able to partially select texts there. That&#8217;s the type of thing that really brings the writing experience in the editor to be on par with how you would expect a text editing experience to work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And there are tons of small quality of life improvements in this release that I think are really gonna help those end-users. But there are also improvements around what we might call the maintainers who are building sites for others. I think block locking in particular is something that is really going to start filling a gap between people who build the sites and then people who do the day-to-day maintenance within a site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, in 6.0, we&#8217;re introducing some interface UI around block locking, but also there&#8217;ll be control around the ability to lock user roles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:09:03]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Which I think makes a lot of sense. I mean, we have all of these user roles in the CMS itself, and for a long time, we&#8217;ve just been like free for all on blocks, which was great and is great and should be available to people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But also if we are saying, like, it makes sense to have this gradient of users and their abilities for the CMS itself, and we are saying that we want to move control of the website and the content to be at the base layer in these blocks, then it also makes sense that we should be able to provide that same sort of granular level of access in the blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I think that&#8217;s a great thing. If you all, if dear listeners, you do not know what we mean by “block locking,” I&#8217;m sure that I can find a link for us in our show notes below as well. If for anyone who&#8217;s been talking through Gutenberg things with me for a while, you know that this is one of the primary use cases that I think has been a long time coming.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:10:05]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was one of the first examples that I offered to folks when we had that question of like, who is this being built for? In what way is this beneficial to that mid-end user, as opposed to just giving all of the power and autonomy to users in a way that maybe is not the best for their visitors?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is one of those use cases that made the most sense to me being able to say, okay, well, the opportunity to, as somebody who runs an agency and is building websites for people to be able to say, yeah, ‘You can do anything that is possible in this instance of WordPress and all the things that you are allowed to do will not break your instance. It won&#8217;t break your website’.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so it gives a lot of time back to agencies to focus on their client&#8217;s most important problems, as opposed to not knowing how to update the hours in their footer or something like that. And so I&#8217;m very excited about that particular feature.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong> 00:11:01]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s such a long-requested feature. I mean, we&#8217;ve been hearing requests around this particular feature for years and, you know, often when something gets requested over a span of years like that, it&#8217;s because there are some complexities to figure out how it works.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that&#8217;s definitely been the case with moving forward with block locking. And there are a lot of nuances there. But I think what you were saying, I totally agree with. There’s always a push and pull. And as we enable more and more flexibility for end-users, there needs to be a little bit of push from the other side to kind of give more granular controls, more locking options, and make sure that everything can still be easily maintained.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:11:43]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, we mentioned in that answer the concept of maintainers. If you are a contributor, it&#8217;s not <em>that</em> kind of ‘maintainer.’ So if you&#8217;re a WordPress contributor and we said maintainers there, um, just know that that&#8217;s not what we&#8217;re referring to. If you don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;m talking about when I say ‘contributor,’ there is a whole community of open source people and maintainers are people who specifically take care of a particular part of the WordPress software or the WordPress project, um, that makes all this possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there&#8217;s, ya know….&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong> 00:12:19] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So true! The maintainer has another meaning in this context.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:12:20]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, we have a mix in our audience and I love it, but it also makes me frequently spend like 10% of my podcast being like, by the way, when I said this, I didn&#8217;t mean you, but I did mean <em>you</em>, which makes it harder. I know.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So. You’ve been with the project for a little bit, but if I recall correctly, this is the first time that you were, like, leading part of a release.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what would you say was the most challenging part of that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong>  00:12:52] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another great question. This is my first time being this closely involved with the release. Although I was involved with the 5.9 release, but mostly in a release assets capacity. So I helped with the <em>About Page</em> and the welcome banner that goes on the dashboard.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I did get some insight in the last release cycle. Which was great preparation for being more involved as a release lead on this cycle. From the design perspective, one of the hardest things is always going to be figuring out what exactly goes into the release and what needs more time. In the sense, you know, that there might be some features that need to stay in the Gutenberg plugin for a while and get more testing before they get released to a much wider audience in a major WordPress release.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I think on the design side, we definitely have some goals that are big, long-term projects that are likely going to span across, you know, many releases, maybe even over many years. And I think the full site editor is a great example of that in a sense that it&#8217;s not something that you just were gone in one release and then it all gets released and then it&#8217;s all good to go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong>  00:14:06] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s something that has to be staggered across many releases, and there&#8217;s a lot of thought that goes into it; does this make sense in this more limited capacity, and what else needs to go in in order for this feature to go in? And the most complex things about the WordPress project is how interconnected things are.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So when you start making those decisions about what should go in, what should get pulled out, often there&#8217;s sort of a domino effect of like, well, that would affect this feature and then, well, maybe they shouldn&#8217;t go in, or maybe this does need to go in. And that is really one of the most challenging, but also one of the most fascinating aspects of the release process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:14:46] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes. It is very, very true that there are kind of no small problems left in WordPress. *laughs* Yeah, when we, when we first started with this like bigger release squad, cause that has not been routine for the history of the project. When we first started with that, I know that expanding out the exposure to like how much one change affects 25 different things was really, it was really good for all of us to be reminded.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And as I mentioned at the top of our episode today, tomorrow begins the RC period. It begins the release candidate period, which is when it&#8217;s supposed to be, as locked down as possible. But if you all have been following along with our release process in general, which if you&#8217;re listening to this, you probably have, you know that last week or a couple of weeks ago, we had this whole question about the Webfonts API, and we had that conversation in a public space as best we could,&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like, there are always things that you can&#8217;t, like, fully disclose in public spaces, but we had a very open and transparent conversation about, like, who is most affected by putting it in, in the state that the API was in. And, who&#8217;s most affected if we take it out. And where can we make compromises on either side so that both sides are a little happy and a little unhappy?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:16:09] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, like, that is all so hard to do. Not only in general. We have a 20-year-old code base and a five-year-old code base. And it&#8217;s all a big, big undertaking to understand what is happening and where it happens. And so there&#8217;s this moment always when we are trying to decide, like, is this baked enough? Did we put it in too early? Should we pull it out? How, if we pull it out, did we ask people to do too much work before we decided to pull it out anyway?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like, you always have those kinds of questions about it. And honestly, I think that most of us weren&#8217;t around the last time, that WordPress was, was this experimental in public, like it&#8217;s always been open source. It&#8217;s always been experimental and iterating publicly, which is just the hardest way to work on anything. We like, we shipped our best guesses. Don&#8217;t be mad. It&#8217;ll be… we&#8217;re coming for it. We&#8217;re going to fix it. Like, that&#8217;s always hard, but the last time around, when it was this substantial a change was, like, 2008 or something, like, it was ages and ages ago.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong>  00:17:14] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And we were smaller than, we had a smaller number of contributors. We had a smaller group of people actually using the CMS. And so over time it has gotten more and more complicated. And, and I don&#8217;t think that we can ever understate the complexities of that. And so for you, you had a little bit of exposure to it in 5.9 and then showed up for like really doing it in 6.0.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Has it been a surprising change? Like, were you surprised much more by how complicated it was when you were closer to it?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong> 00:17:47] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, definitely. It’s been a real learning process, especially coming to understand how much there really are no easy answers. I think a lot of us are in the release squad are real problem solver types of people and, and want it to, you know, be a really neat, tidy answer.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it&#8217;s not always the case. You know, sometimes parts of the feature might go in, or some contingency plan might get put into place and things didn&#8217;t go exactly as planned. But what you said of being an experiment and being on kind of the cutting edge of trying out new things, I think there is a lot of passion around that in the WordPress project.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right now, we&#8217;re in such a transitional period for the project, you know, moving from classic themes to block themes and really changing the ideas of how we approach designing sites. And because of that, I think there is a lot of momentum and energy around getting new features, as many new features as possible into each release. But there&#8217;s also, you know, a lot of testing and stuff that needs to happen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And to make sure that, like you said, these things aren&#8217;t going out too early.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:19:01] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, and there&#8217;s always that difficulty, we&#8217;re going to just leap right into open source areas now. There&#8217;s always that difficulty around, like, there&#8217;s this concept that when, like, we always want to ship something that doesn&#8217;t break backward compatibility when possible, we don&#8217;t want to ship vulnerabilities. Like, that&#8217;s always true, but we are in an open source project, and open source projects are necessarily kind of tolerant of like, that&#8217;s not our best, but like it skates, right?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This was, we aimed for Ferrari and got a skateboard because sometimes you got to start with a skateboard, right? *laughter* Like if it gets you from one place to another, that&#8217;s kind of where we&#8217;ve got to aim some days.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong> 00:19:45] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Totally.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong>  00:19:46] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that&#8217;s always so, so difficult, especially cause, like, for the big change that 5.0 represented, and that 5.9 represented– 6.0 is not as big a shock as 5.9 was.&nbsp; But, like, as big a change as those represented, it still skates. And that&#8217;s, I think what makes the work especially hard, especially nuanced. And like, we haven&#8217;t gotten together as human beings in two years. And so sometimes people just kind of forget there&#8217;s a human being back there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;re humans. Everyone be nice. Yeah. I don&#8217;t know that part of running a release definitely was surprising to me. My first release that I ran was 5.0 and…</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong> 00:20:31] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, wow!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:20:32]</p>\n\n\n\n<p> Yeah, it was, like, that was  2018. And then I became the executive director at the top of 2019. And I distinctly remember one core chat where I showed up and just was like the most transparent, vulnerable person we&#8217;ve ever experienced in life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s not true. We have very vulnerable people in the project and very transparent people, but I told everyone like, there are a million of you and one of me, and it&#8217;s kind of terrifying that you&#8217;re leaping on me in this—like you&#8217;re scaring me a lot right now. And that was quite a thing to say to like, all these… it&#8217;s terrifying! Right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong> 00:21:12] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I love when you see that type of vulnerability in the project. I think it takes… it takes a degree of comfort and familiarity with the project to even be able to admit to that. And to me, that&#8217;s a real sign of growth in the project. Like when I first started contributing, I don&#8217;t think I ever would have just said, like, ‘How is the feature supposed to work? I have no idea.’ That&#8217;s something that I say all the time now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>*Laughter*</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And you know, that is completely fine and more than okay. It&#8217;s a massive project. There are folks who have done deep thinking about a feature over the course of years. You know, and there are experts who can help shed light on various problems that maybe you just haven&#8217;t had a chance to dive into yet and really understand the nuances of yet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that&#8217;s the amazing thing about open source is that you can lean on folks who do have expertise in that particular area. You&#8217;re not expected to be an expert-expert in every single domain. It&#8217;s okay to say, I don&#8217;t really have a good idea or a good concept of this feature. I don&#8217;t have a good feeling for it. What do other folks think?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong> 00:22:24] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And even people who have been in the project for a long time, decade plus, still say that all the time. You know, or you might just say, like, I have a really rough idea of how this works, are other people seeing this the same way? Or did other people have a different, you know, mental picture of how this might work?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even if, sometimes it feels like you&#8217;re over-communicating, it&#8217;s really helpful because often people do have really dramatically different ideas about how a feature might take shape.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:22:49] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I hope that&#8217;s one of the things that we never lose in the project. Like we are an old, old project now and we support a bunch of the web with a tiny, tiny group of people compared to the amount of the web that we support.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I hope that we always have that opportunity as senior leaders, which I am, and all of our upcoming leaders to all of us, just at some point, be like, can we stop the train? I don&#8217;t understand. I don’t understand that. Um, and not necessarily feel that that has made us a worse contributor. Cause I think that it&#8217;s when we are transparent about our lack of understanding.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s when we have the opportunity to make what we&#8217;re offering to the world more solid and always better.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong> 00:23:35] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I love it. I think it&#8217;s the, one of the most lovely things about the WordPress community. There&#8217;s really low judgment around those types of questions and people are really inclusive and more than happy to take a moment to explain something to you or shed some light on an issue you might not have thought that much about.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think that&#8217;s one of the best things you can always reach out for help. And folks are always willing to provide guidance or context or even historical information about, you know, whether it&#8217;s been tried in the past or previous explorations and that sort of thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:24:10] </p>\n\n\n\n<p> All right. Well, that covers all of my questions for you. Do you have a final thought about the release that you would like to share with everyone you don&#8217;t have to, if you don&#8217;t want to, not everyone has like a final sign off.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong> 00:24:25] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. One of the things I&#8217;m most excited about for this 6.0 release is all of the improvements around design tools.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And these are just small improvements around a ton of different things, like the color panel, border controls, gap support, typography options, flexible container blocks, etc. These are the types of tools that are a designer&#8217;s dream. You know, they really make the difference between being able to make a really crisp, finished looking final product and having something that&#8217;s a little rough around the edges.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And as a designer, like those are the things that your eye goes straight towards. And all of these nuanced new tools, they really allow designers to have that fine detailed control to create really pixel perfect sites. And I think that&#8217;s something that, you know, myself and a lot of others on the design team are just so beyond excited about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:25:25]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Excellent. Well, Channing, thank you so much for joining us today on the WordPress Briefing; it has been an absolute delight.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong> 00:25:32] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you for having me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:25:41] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And now it is time, woohoo, for the small list of big things. My favorite part of this podcast, that&#8217;s not true. I have a lot of things that I love about this podcast. I just, in particular love being able to share like three things that are coming up in the next couple of weeks that everybody should be aware of. And I really particularly like the list I have this week.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First as of today, we are two weeks away from WordSesh. If you&#8217;re looking forward to your first in-person WordPress event, but feel like you could use a little foundation information, a little bit of a WordPress primer, then this event has a lot of excellent thought leaders in the project that you can learn from.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re looking for more practical or hands-on opportunities, uh, you can also check out social learning spaces. All of those are free for anyone. So I will include links to both of them in the show notes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:26:30]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Second, as of today, we are four weeks away from WordCamp Europe. This is one of our flagship events. So it also includes a contributor day, which I encourage you to look into. If you have never heard of one before. I will be there to meet some of the contributors that have joined the project since the end of 2019. And hopefully, I will see you there as well. If you&#8217;ve never heard of a contributor day, then I&#8217;ll include a link to the beginner&#8217;s guide to contributions, a little talk that I gave in 2017 in the show notes that should help you get your bearings or at the very least know what questions to ask yourself to figure out if a contributor day is right for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the third thing as of today, it has been one week since <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/iandunn/\">Ian Dunn</a> and the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/meta/\">Meta</a> developers… Um, that sounds like a band… Ian Dunn and the Meta developers connected the props channel in the community Slack to WordPress.org profile activity. I&#8217;m really excited about this. It&#8217;s the first in a long list of changes that are part of a larger project to credit more non-code contributions, more contributions that are not specific to a major release or event.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And also to set us up to be able to provide more quality checks and balances for our growing Five for the Future program. If you&#8217;ve not been over there lately, if you&#8217;re not super sure what I&#8217;m talking about, there&#8217;s a link to the discussion post that we had about it, but also you can wander right over into the Making WordPress Slack and check out the props channel to just kind of see a running list of contributors that people are really grateful for.

From using the software as a basic website tool to helping entrepreneurs and good causes around the world fulfill their aspirations, she has overcome personal barriers and now aims to inspire others.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meher found her vocation and learned new skills through WordPress. She also discovered a way to encourage other women to consider careers in IT.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Opening the doors to a career in technology</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As a child, Meher was diagnosed with dyslexia (difficulty in reading the written word) and dyscalculia (difficulty in comprehending numbers and mathematical functions). With the support of her parents and a tutor, she was able to overcome this learning obstacle. She developed coping techniques and a determination to work to overcome challenges as they appeared later in life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In school, she got an opportunity to replace one subject with computer studies as an alternative. This proved to be an eye-opener to future career possibilities.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She began to research not only what the internet had to offer but also how it worked, including the new and fascinating concepts of email and websites. Her father bought the family’s first desktop computer so she could do her research at home.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meher’s father wanted to turn her love for computers into something that would serve her well in the future. In 2005, he enrolled her in a short computer course from a global IT training provider. The course tutor was so impressed with her performance, she was advised to enroll in a four year software development course.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That meant she had studied the software development course alongside her higher education college course. Looking back, she enjoyed the dual challenge of the degree course in commerce, and the experience prepared her well to keep learning software while working as a developer. Within three years, she had learned C#, C, C++, HTML, Java, and .NET. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>After graduation, she was in a dilemma to choose between commerce and IT. What to choose? She had a compulsory one-year technology internship to complete, and her choice of focus for that year would prove to be a defining moment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2009, on her birthday, Meher was offered an internship. On the first day of the internship, she was introduced to WordPress. Her initial assignment was to change the look and feel of the WordPress dashboard — in just six hours. But there was a problem &#8211; she had never worked with WordPress before!</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>&#8220;I stared at the whiteboard and thought that task given was impossible and difficult to meet the deadline. I wondered if my boss was joking and did not know then what you could do with WordPress as a developer and how it could slot into your toolbox. It opened my eyes.&#8221;&nbsp;</p><cite>Meher Bala</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Meher used her research skills to know more about using WordPress. She found a plugin that would help her achieve her task. She met the deadline and it ingrained an interest that she would never lose. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Re-discovering WordPress</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Five years after her initial WordPress experience, Meher was assigned to lead an international project in WordPress.&nbsp;She was hesitant — she had lost touch with the CMS during that five years, but the project was a great opportunity to become a team leader and lead from the front.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She decided to update her WordPress skills, relying again on the strength of her research skills and determination. In the process, she also taught her team all about WordPress, inspiring many of those members to continue to develop their WordPress skill set.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The success of that project was a pivotal moment for Meher and a new dawn as a developer specializing in WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a team lead, Meher soon found it was not possible to always have all the answers straight away. She found internet searches gave practical solutions—but rarely explained the theory behind it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So she went looking for a WordPress group to help her expand the scope and depth of her knowledge.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Finding the community and its developer learning opportunities </h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"999\" height=\"667\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/04/dsc_00345.jpg?resize=999%2C667&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Meher at WordCamp Nagpur in 2017\" class=\"wp-image-12762\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/04/dsc_00345.jpg?w=999&amp;ssl=1 999w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/04/dsc_00345.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/04/dsc_00345.jpg?resize=768%2C513&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 999px) 100vw, 999px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption>Meher enjoying being part of <em>WordCamp Nagpur in 2017</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2015, while browsing Facebook, Meher came across an advertisement for something called WordCamp Mumbai, an event that had taken two days before. She did a little digging to learn what a WordCamp was, and about the people behind it. She took the plunge and joined the WordPress Mumbai Meetup group.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Her first Meetup experience was not love at first sight. She felt the topics were for advanced users, and the timing late in the evening made it difficult to attend.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But a few months later, the Meetup addressed a topic that could help her resolve an issue in one of her current projects. She made the effort to show up and came away with a number of important tips.&nbsp;The speaker had taken the time to speak to individual attendees. When he came to Meher, she took the opportunity to ask a couple of questions about her project issues. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thereafter she went to more Meetups and got to know the people behind this group, just as they started talking about WordCamp Mumbai 2016.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>A WordCamp adventure</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/04/wcm16.jpg?resize=600%2C800&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Meher pictured with the WordCamp Mumbai 2016 sign \" class=\"wp-image-12758\" width=\"600\" height=\"800\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/04/wcm16.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/04/wcm16.jpg?resize=225%2C300&amp;ssl=1 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption>Meher discovering <em>WordCamps in Mumbai in 2016</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Meher expressed interest in being a part of the coming&nbsp; WordCamp Mumbai and started in an entry-level role with basic responsibilities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At first, she thought WordCamp was a formal conference with about 100 people. So on the first day of WordCamp Mumbai 2016, she was surprised to see so many WordCamp enthusiasts attending and enjoying such a relaxed and friendly conference.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After that great experience, Meher went to many more meetups and did more volunteering. She started taking on responsibilities in the coming WordCamps and getting to know the different aspects of the camp.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the following years, at each WordPress, she took up a new role like speaker vetting, sponsors, and volunteer coordination. This allowed her to know more about what an organizer needs to do, from planning to execution, to make WordCamp a successful event.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"900\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/04/wcmumbai-17.jpg?resize=900%2C600&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"WordCamp Mumbai 2017 group photo of the team\" class=\"wp-image-12765\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/04/wcmumbai-17.jpg?w=900&amp;ssl=1 900w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/04/wcmumbai-17.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/04/wcmumbai-17.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption>With the team at <em>WordCamp Mumbai in 2017</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Meher is grateful for her WordPress journey which was fostered in the Mumbai community. It has been filled with beautiful surprises.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When people ask why she’s chosen to specialize professionally in WordPress, Meher says WordPress is easy to teach a non-technical person, yet it is still highly customizable. Being a WordPress developer has given her the opportunity to work&nbsp; remotely for global web development companies that let her think out of the box. And she learns new skills with every release.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>The community makes WordPress special</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Meher says that some of her most memorable WordPress moments have revolved around special friendships, trying new things, and participating in community building.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress has let her explore different parts of India, make new friends locally and internationally, and encourage women to be a part of meetup groups and events across India.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of Meher’s biggest dreams was to lead WordCamp Mumbai as a lead organizer and show others what could be achieved by working together in open source. In 2019, she did just that and has volunteered at international WordCamps and meetups since.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"515\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/04/wc-19.jpg?resize=1024%2C515&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Meher speaking at WordCamp Mumbai 2019\" class=\"wp-image-12731\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/04/wc-19.jpg?resize=1024%2C515&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/04/wc-19.jpg?resize=300%2C151&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/04/wc-19.jpg?resize=768%2C386&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/04/wc-19.jpg?w=1247&amp;ssl=1 1247w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption>Taking to the stage at WordCamp Mumbai in 2019</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>As part of her enthusiasm for sharing the opportunities WordPress can give people, especially women, she has given time to co-organize two global <a href=\"https://wptranslationday.org/\">WordPress Translation month long events</a> and contributor events in India.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meher said: “I was first introduced to translation at one of the meetups which was organised to support the WordPress Translation Day. I realized this was another way to support my local communities and bring the power of WordPress to them by contributing in Gujarati and Hindi. I did not imagine I would a few years later be a global organizer for the event itself!”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With her commitment to ongoing learning as a developer and to model what she believes about the value and community growth opportunities of open source, Meher has given time and energy to the Marketing Team, where she has been a Team Rep, to the Training Team, and to the Core Team contributing to multiple releases.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The developer adventure with WordPress is unlimited</h2>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>At the start of my software developer journey, I always thought the C++ and Java were the only skills you required to excel in your career. From the time I started exploring WordPress in depth, I realized the potential and the power of WordPress in web development.</p><cite>Meher Bala</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Being a part of the WordPress community, Meher learned that there is so much more than just building blogs on WordPress. She started exploring different features of WordPress, created her first theme, and eventually specialized as a frontend specialist.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meher now works as a consultant and front end developer with an international agency specializing in WordPress. Asked what she thought was the best thing about being a WordPress developer, Meher replied: &#8220;Through WordPress, I have an opportunity to build unique out of the box websites and work&nbsp;remotely for global web development companies that encourages you to think out of the box. There is always opportunity to continuously advance my coding skills and learn new techniques with every release.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>She believes that there is no limit to where using the software can take you and what you can combine it with to find solutions to projects big and small.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you earn a living from WordPress, her advice is from the heart: try to give back to the WordPress community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I am sure you will learn or teach something new and definitely make friends across the world. There is no shame in making mistakes, as you can learn from them and develop your skills further.

And welcome to the WordPress Briefing. The podcast where you can catch quick explanations of the ideas behind the WordPress open source project, some insight into the community that supports it, and get a small list of big things coming up in the next two weeks. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here we go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:00:39] </strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All right. So you&#8217;ve been listening to this podcast for a while. You may be one of these contributors I keep mentioning; you may be an agency owner or freelancer. Maybe you&#8217;ve wondered how to make a WordPress blog for your big idea. Or, maybe you&#8217;re one of the many people who use WordPress for their project or business. Before WordPress was known as a content management system, as a way to get sites online fast, it was a blogging tool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have long since outgrown that, but even 19 years into our journey, blogging is still a key part of what WordPress enables you to do. That&#8217;s because even after those 19 years, the mission of WordPress is still the same. And that is to democratize publishing, to help people have a place online where they can tell their stories or share their projects or set up their businesses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;ve ever tried to set up a blog, you know that there isn&#8217;t a lot of information about what to know before you get going at all. So I&#8217;m going to talk about that a little bit today. And just by the way, if you heard the word blog right now and thought, oh, Josepha, how old fashioned? I think it&#8217;s important to remember that there&#8217;s a business advantage to having well-written, relevant content on your website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:01:59]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if you&#8217;re not blogging for business, because not all of us are, then the benefits are a little different but still important to my mind. Things like the cathartic benefits of journaling, a chance to build community, and the general importance of preserving wisdom for the ages. Anyway, back to the topic at hand. Before we can get to any of the fancy things that WordPress can do nowadays, it&#8217;s important to know a few things as you get ready to set up your first ever website.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So let&#8217;s dive in. Here is how you need to get yourself started. First, have an idea and a plan. So have an idea for what you&#8217;re doing, the concept of your content, who you want to reach, and some concept of a domain name. I would encourage you to not necessarily get your heart set on a domain name at first. Cause, like, if you want the domain name, wordpress.org, like we own that, you can have that! But if you know that you want a domain like WordPressbloggingforthefuture.com, like that one might be more available. And if you know the kind of words you want in your domain, you can be a bit flexible about what is there.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:03:09]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing that you need to do is that if you are just getting started, ask yourself the question, what sort of host do I want? We kind of mentioned all along the WordPress process that, like, you need a good host, but it’s not always clear where that decision has to happen. It happens right here at the start, before you even know what WordPress is most of the time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, the earliest question that you have to answer for yourself is what sort of host do I want? Where do I want my site to live? So ask yourself how much you want to get into the maintenance and configuration of your website and the hardware that it lives on versus creating content or keeping your shop up to date.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s this whole spectrum of hosting options, and they range from full service where they will keep your WordPress software up to date, provide daily backups, and have customer support if something goes really wrong. So it ranges all the way from full service like that all the way down to essentially zero services, just kind of hands-off.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:04:11]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>They give you a space to keep your WordPress software, to keep your WordPress site. But they leave everything else up to you. They leave the backups up to you. They leave updating up to you, things like. So that&#8217;s the first thing you have to ask yourself. And the first question you have to be able to answer. Most of the time, you will want to start with one of the full-service options. That way, you know that your software is set up correctly and safely from the start. And as you learn more about the software and what you want and what you need, and you have the ability to learn in the time that you have, the more that you can add on either service with the existing hosts that you chose or moving to a different host; however that works out for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if that one sounds like the right option, then you choose a host, go to their site, and actually most of them will have a way to walk you through how to set up a WordPress site inside their system. Most of the time, it&#8217;s just one click and then they ask you some questions to get some configurations right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:05:10]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The other option that on the like zero, zero service side, that&#8217;s not quite fair, but you know, the other side of that spectrum that probably will be appealing to you if you are already familiar with code or already know how to manage a server or, or you know how to work in this thing called c-panel, et cetera.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if you already have a lot of information on how all of that works, you can, if you want to, head over to wordpress.org/download, and you can download a zip file of the WordPress software and set that up in your own environment.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay, quick check here. If this all sounds roughly doable to you, or at least it feels like we&#8217;re in the right starting point, but you find yourself thinking, gosh, I just wish she would slow down a little.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve got you covered. In the show notes, you&#8217;ll find a link to one of the Learn WP courses for getting started with WordPress. There&#8217;s a section on choosing a host as well as various other early steps of this process. So if you felt like I blazed through all of that, which honestly I kind of did, you can work through those lessons in that course, at your own pace, and it&#8217;s, and it&#8217;s really a very good guide.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:06:24]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>All right. Let&#8217;s pretend we did all of that. Now you&#8217;ve got yourself a website. The thing that you will want to do next, or rather the first thing that you&#8217;ll notice once you get your site up and running, is that there&#8217;s this ‘Hello World’ post– there&#8217;s a post that already exists in there. The Hello World post is a placeholder for the common features of a blog post.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There, you can find your featured image, your title, your content, and even some fake comments. You can either edit this post so that you can see how your writing will look from the start, and you can kind of compare like, okay, the Hello World part over here on this page, exists in this field over here on this page. So you can kind of see where everything works, how it all looks together. Or, if you&#8217;re more familiar with WordPress or CMS in general, you can simply remove that and start fresh.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:07:17]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we&#8217;ve got now a website, we know, kind of, how to look at our posts and create posts, where comments are, where they can kind of be moderated and stuff. And so, the most fun task for everyone is choosing a theme. But if it&#8217;s not a fun task, if it doesn&#8217;t sound like a fun task to you, I can help you kind of do some, choose your own adventure guiding questions here.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Firstly, you can ask yourself how you want the site to look. Do you want it to mostly be a lot of photos or entirely words, mostly animations? You can head to the theme directory and search for a theme with most of the features that you want. There&#8217;s like a filtering system where you can put in, like, you want three columns so that you can have three columns of text if you want it to look kind of like an old school newspaper kind of layout and things like.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:08:12]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s also a way to look for themes inside your instance, your WordPress site, but like, if you haven&#8217;t set that up yet, but you do still want to see kind of what your theme options are, you can go to wordpress.org/themes and and take a look at what&#8217;s out there. Just as a quick side note, if you get to that theme directory, if you get to wordpress.org/themes, and it feels overwhelming, which I can understand, I recommend starting with a theme that is designed for blogging specifically so that you can see how things look right away.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And there&#8217;s actually a theme that does come with every WordPress site. So if you&#8217;re not ready, you can skip this thing entirely and just work with the theme that&#8217;s already there. Every word, press instance ships with a theme and it is fully functional when you, when you get your site up and running. So you don&#8217;t need to choose a theme right now if you don&#8217;t feel ready.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the other very fun thing that people do with their WordPress sites is to add plugins to them. So plugins are these little pieces of software that you add on to the WordPress software that lets it do additional things. It adds additional functionality. The questions that you can ask to kind of guide yourself through what sorts of plugins you might want, what sorts of functionality you might want to add to your site are a little similar to the ones that you want to ask for figuring out which theme.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:09:36]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So figure out if there are tasks that you need visitors to do. Do you need them to contact you? Do you want them to watch a video? Should they review and respond to questions?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have a concept of the things that you want users to do on your website, then you can head to the plugin directory and search for a plugin with features that you need. Also, there are just endless lists of recommended plugins out there; if that is something that you find valuable as part of your research, those are also easy to find.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And as a general side note here, there are even more plugins than there are themes. So if you have gotten to this point and feel like you don&#8217;t quite know the answers to the questions that I shared, and, and it&#8217;s going to be a while until you feel like you can know what those answers are. That&#8217;s totally fine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ll tell you this. I have never seen a site without a contact form. So feel free to begin your journey there. There are a lot of great plugins for contact forms and it can kind of help you figure out how to work with plugins in that way. So yeah, I made it sound like you can get a WordPress website built in like seven minutes and on the one hand you definitely can.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:09:36]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And on the other hand, it&#8217;s still a little bit more complicated. So here I have a final note for everyone. You will hear around the WordPress ecosystem. And obviously, here, are some things that could make you feel a little nervous about doing this for the first time. Things like the five-second installation, which WordPress has been famous for years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But also about how easy and simple it all is. And as somebody who was once in the position of learning WordPress for the first time, like I first encountered a WordPress site in 2009 and I started learning how to use WordPress in 2010. So I can say with confidence that once you learn it, it&#8217;s easy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We are the easiest of the hard options for CMS. Like content management systems are just complicated, but we are the easiest one out there. And so, as you&#8217;re learning, I want to just remind you to celebrate your small wins along the way. If you feel like you&#8217;re late to this blogging game, like you should have had a website for years. I mean, sure that could be true. And yes, the best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. But the second-best time to plant that tree is today.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress didn&#8217;t start out powering over 40% of the web, and your first site can&#8217;t be immediately measured in the millions of readers. So, what will your small beginning lead you to?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:12:25]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And now that brings us to our small list of big things.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first one, the next release of WordPress, WordPress 6.0, has reached its beta phase. That means the full focus is on finding and fixing the bugs we accidentally created during this development cycle. Beta two comes out tomorrow and you can follow along in the core channel in the Making WordPress Slack.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;ve never seen how those releases get packaged, and if you just want to keep an eye on what everybody&#8217;s doing so that you can be the first to know, yeah, Making WordPress Slack is the way to go.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing on our small list is that speaking of WordPress 6.0, we had the public walk through a couple of weeks ago, which means that in a few weeks, I&#8217;ll do a WordPress 6.0 sneak peek. I&#8217;ll share some highlights of the release features and why I think they are super important for you to take a look. Sooner rather than later.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:13:22]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the final, big thing, if you are new to WordPress and this episode has you all fired up to start your blog, we have a bunch of contributors over on the Learn WP team that have just the thing for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can join the online social learning space called How to Make a WordPress Blog. It&#8217;s a free online event that will help you get started. I&#8217;ll link the information in the show notes below. And I&#8217;ll also share in the show notes, a list of WordPress Meetup groups, where you can find more opportunities to learn and get support from other people locally who are also doing things with WordPress.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But you can also find a list in the dashboard of your newly installed WordPress blog you no doubt have after this podcast.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that my friends is your small list of big things.

Please do not install, run, and test this version of WordPress on a production or mission-critical website. Instead, it is recommended that you test Beta 1 on a test server and site.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can test the WordPress 6.0 Beta 1 in three ways:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Option 1: Install and activate the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/\">WordPress Beta Tester</a> plugin (select the “Bleeding edge” channel and “Beta/RC Only” stream).</li><li>Option 2: Direct download the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/wordpress-6.0-beta1.zip\">beta version here (zip)</a>.</li><li>Option 3: Use WP-CLI to test: <code>wp core update --version=6.0-beta1</code>. <br><strong><em>Do not use this option if your filesystem is case-insensitive.</em></strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The current target for the final release is May 24, 2022, which is about six weeks away.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additional information on the full <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/6-0/\">6.0 release cycle is available</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Check the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/\">Make WordPress Core blog</a> for <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/tag/dev-notes+6-0/\">6.0-related developer notes</a> in the coming weeks which will detail all upcoming changes.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Keep WordPress Bug Free – Help with Testing</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Testing for issues is critical for stabilizing a release throughout its development. Testing is also a great way to contribute. If you have never tested a beta release before, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/test/2022/04/12/help-wanted-test-wordpress-6-0/\">this detailed guide</a> will walk you through how to get started.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Testing helps make sure that this and future releases of WordPress are as stable and issue-free as possible. And anyone can do it – especially great WordPress community members just like you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Want to know more about testing releases like this one? Read about the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/test/\">testing initiatives</a> that happen in Make Core. You can also join a <a href=\"https://wordpress.slack.com/messages/core-test/\">publicly-accessible channel</a> on the <a href=\"https://wordpress.slack.com\">Making WordPress Slack workspace</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you think you have run into an issue, please report it to the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/forum/alphabeta/\">Alpha/Beta area</a> in the support forums. If you are comfortable writing a reproducible bug report, you can <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/newticket\">file one on WordPress Trac</a>.

And welcome to the WordPress Briefing: the podcast where you can catch quick explanations of the ideas behind the WordPress open source project, some insight into the community that supports it and get a small list of big things coming up in the next two weeks. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:00:40]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was checking the list of upcoming events recently as part of just my regular work and saw that the call for organizers for WordCamp Asia is open. On the one hand, it made my heart skip a beat with excitement. That event is six years or so in the making. And on the other hand, it reminded me of February 10th, 2020, the day that Matt told me that we had to proactively cancel WordCamp Asia. That week was truly heartbreaking for me as well as I think the entire organizing team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it also, fortunately, was prescient. As I think back over the two years since then, I&#8217;m grateful for our community wranglers and deputies who have consistently hosted important discussions about how to return to in-person events safely. And with two of our major flagship events returning this year, I&#8217;m here to summarize, sort of, what the rules and guidelines are.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But certainly I hope that you come away from this with an idea of what&#8217;s being done to keep everyone safe as we are best able.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:01:44]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Firstly, before we dig into specifics, I want to be clear upfront that the guidelines for COVID-aware events are mandatory, unless otherwise stated. For folks who&#8217;ve been attending WordPress events, or participating in the community for a long time, this is a change. As a program, we have always done our best to be flexible with guidelines so that we can prioritize local knowledge. But our responsibility is to the long-term success of this community and this program. So moving forward with in-person events that risk the health of our community members poses risks to the program itself. So with that in mind, let&#8217;s learn what we&#8217;re going to see at events for the rest of the.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:02:28]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>For any WordPress event that is gathering more than 50 people, the new mandatory guidelines are:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Number one, follow local laws and guidelines. If your area has suggested guidelines on top of the mandatory ones, follow those.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Second, is if you are in a location where laws or guidelines require or permit venues to limit admission based on a person&#8217;s vaccination status and masking, then events can only happen in venues that are willing to provide staff to check for vaccination status at the door. And then also to remind participants to wear masks during the event.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the third thing is if your area or venue legally cannot check vaccination status, your area must pass the in-person checklist, which I will link in the show notes below. But that in-person checklist has to be passed at the time of the application and then again at the time of the event. And in addition to that, the venue must be willing to provide staff who will remind participants to wear masks and check for temperature during the event.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:03:33]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Organizers in these areas must be prepared to move online or cancel if the region fails the safety checklist, which again, will be linked in the show notes below. So those are the three things and they are pretty dense, but also I think allow for a fair amount of flexibility. There is also a tidy flow chart linked in the sidebar of make.wordpress.org/community that will help you to decide what sort of event your own area can support right now.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So those are the mandatory guidelines for WordPress events in general right now, but you probably also have a few specific questions. So I&#8217;ve got the three most common questions ready to go with answers from Angela Jin who helped me to kind of pull together the information for this particular podcast props to Angela. Thank you.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:04:25]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, first question, anything specific to know about WordCamp Europe? WordCamp Europe will be following these guidelines as well. All attendees and participants are expected to wear a mask while they are at the event and catering will be offered outside so people can remove their masks to eat.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second common question is how will these guidelines change as countries and local governments begin deescalating restrictions and safety measures? We should consider these guidelines to be subject to evolution based on what the team is hearing and seeing from the community. But right now we intend to keep these stricter guidelines in place until we see how the loosened rules play out elsewhere.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then a third frequent question is what&#8217;s going to happen to all these online events?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The community team will continue to support online events right now. So if your community doesn&#8217;t feel ready to have an in-person event, but still wants to kind of get everyone together that is still allowed, and still&nbsp; encouraged. And finally the community team will continue to keep a close eye on situations around the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If it becomes safe to do so, and your community is interested, they of course will be happy to chat with you about a WordCamp. There is an application that I will share the link to in the show notes below as well. In case that is something that your community is wanting to look into.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:05:54]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, and I have a little postscript also. I know I was like finally, and now I&#8217;m doing a finally, finally. That&#8217;s what postscripts are about. P.S. If you have not stopped by the community team’s site or any of their meetings, they&#8217;ve been doing a really great job of keeping things moving through two years of unpredictable changes. If you are a community team member, I want to offer you a huge thanks. Thank you so much for helping us to stay aware and able to move forward.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are an organizer, pat yourself on the back. I want to thank you for pivoting with us, moving through online events, even though they are not at all the same as in-person events and certainly they don&#8217;t share the reasons that we get people together sometimes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And finally, if you are an end to end attendee, if you go to WordPress meetups or you go to any sort of WordPress online events or WordCamps, anything like that, thank your local organizer. They have been doing this probably for a while, and I&#8217;m sure that they are looking forward to getting back to in-person events themselves, but even, so they have been putting in a lot of volunteer hours to help make sure that we all know how to use WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so find them, thank them, and I&#8217;m sure that they&#8217;ll appreciate it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:07:20]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And with that, it is time for our small list of big things. Number one, WordCamp Asia has a call for organizers open! This event will be in 2023. And I think that we all simply cannot wait. So I&#8217;ll link the call for organizers in the show notes. And then of course you can follow that whole site to stay up to date on what&#8217;s happening there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing is, while we&#8217;re on the topic of events, there&#8217;s also an open discussion about how we can best support organizers who are getting back to in-person events. We&#8217;d like thoughts from both organizers and attendees. So feel free to drop by and leave a note in the comments section. And while you&#8217;re over there, the third thing in my small list of big things, there&#8217;s also an open discussion about regional events. So go over there, get all your thoughts about WordPress events together. Get them all sorted out in one go. Just leave comments, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. All over the place.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that my friends is your small list of big things. Thank you for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing. I&#8217;m your host Josepha Haden Chomphosy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I&#8217;ll see you again in a couple of weeks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:08:54]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So my most embarrassing WordCamp story actually has to do with where I was supposed to be versus where people thought I was supposed to be. This was early on in my time with WordPress, with Automattic. And I had convinced someone, I had convinced a colleague and friend of mine to go to my home WordCamp, WordCamp Fayetteville over there in Arkansas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then I didn&#8217;t go. But I knew I wasn&#8217;t going, I knew I was going to WordCamp Boston, but he did not know that I was not going to go. And so he arrived at WordCamp Fayetteville, WordCamp Northwest Arkansas. I can&#8217;t remember what it was called at the time. And immediately was confused about where I was and why I wasn&#8217;t there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so there was this excellent moment of mass confusion among states where the folks at WordCamp Fayetteville started tweeting about how I had convinced this contributor to go to that event and then didn&#8217;t show up. And then the folks at WordCamp Boston, we&#8217;re looking at all of those tweets, because if you are a WordCamp organizer, you are always looking at the tweets from all the other WordCamps happening in your weekend.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And people got very confused about why I was in Boston while they were thinking that I was in Fayetteville, even though the tweets were talking about how, like, I wasn&#8217;t in Fayetteville. They probably didn&#8217;t say that it was probably more along the lines of like, “Hey, let&#8217;s share a photo with Josepha” to, like, make fun of the fact that I wasn&#8217;t there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so I caused mass confusion in multiple states. That&#8217;s probably my most embarrassing WordCamp story. You&#8217;re welcome. Bye!</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"12506\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:25;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:75:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n\n					\n										\n					\n		\n		\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:6:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:34:\"People of WordPress: Juan Aldasoro\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:72:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2022/03/people-of-wordpress-juanfra-aldasoro/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 31 Mar 2022 21:42:10 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:7:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:9:\"Community\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"Features\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:2;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:10:\"Interviews\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:3;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:9:\"HeroPress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:4;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:19:\"People of WordPress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:5;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:20:\"Polyglot Contributor\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:6;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:12:\"Support Team\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=12512\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:120:\"The People of WordPress feature this month shares the story of web and plugin developer Juanfra Aldasoro from Argentina.\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"webcommsat AbhaNonStopNewsUK\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:40:\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/\";a:1:{s:7:\"encoded\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:20070:\"\n<p><strong>In this series, we share some of the inspiring stories of how WordPress and its global network of contributors can change people’s lives for the better. This month we feature a website developer and product manager from Argentina, who found in the software a way to live his life in the way he dreamed.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/Juanfra_2333.jpg?resize=1024%2C768&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Juan standing in front of a mural\" class=\"wp-image-12525\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/Juanfra_2333-scaled.jpg?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/Juanfra_2333-scaled.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/Juanfra_2333-scaled.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/Juanfra_2333-scaled.jpg?resize=1536%2C1152&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/Juanfra_2333-scaled.jpg?resize=2048%2C1536&amp;ssl=1 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress offers something to everyone. For Juan Aldasoro, a developer and product manager for a large distributed company, it provides an opportunity to combine his different interests and skills to live the type of life he wanted.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I like visual, creative and technical things. The joy of WordPress is that you can do all of these things, you don’t have to limit yourself to any one aspect . You can also do this from almost anywhere in the world!”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From working in products since 2012, Juan sees WordPress as a major part of his skillset and toolbox. He said: “It gives you an opportunity to be part of building a product which could potentially be used by thousands of people and more on your site. It encourages you to think about different languages and how you can make it accessible. It allows you to work on different platforms. Working in WordPress gives you this broad approach. Working this way on products ended up pushing me into learning about all these different things. Only in open source can you really do this and use your creative side to find solutions.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Learning about being part of a community</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"924\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/Juanfra_2813.jpeg?resize=1024%2C924&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Juan standing in a astreet with murals behind him\" class=\"wp-image-12529\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/Juanfra_2813-scaled.jpeg?resize=1024%2C924&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/Juanfra_2813-scaled.jpeg?resize=300%2C271&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/Juanfra_2813-scaled.jpeg?resize=768%2C693&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/Juanfra_2813-scaled.jpeg?resize=1536%2C1386&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/Juanfra_2813-scaled.jpeg?resize=2048%2C1847&amp;ssl=1 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Born in a mid-sized city in Argentina, Juan was raised in a family in which music, arts and sports were always an essential part of everyday life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“These activities encourage human beings to be creative and participative, and at the same time they are highly formative when it comes to mould people in order to become part of a group, a team, a community.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The youngest of five siblings, Juan became highly motivated, trying to follow the steps of his siblings. Having a computer at home, he started to make connections that laid the foundation for his career as a developer. His interest in computers grew through that access to a machine running MS-DOS &#8211; the one with the black screen command line! Mastering this became a challenge to him and something to share with others. Through doing this, he found a way to more social interaction and new friendships.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Without being conscious of it, my friends and I were sharing pieces of code.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>He said: “I started learning some super easy stuff that made me feel like Houdini at that time. I could save a game play, something intangible, on a floppy disk and carry that piece of plastic and magnetic material back home. I was saving the play or game in a square object and then loading that back at home. I now realize, those were my first interactions with computer commands. Without being conscious of it, my friends and I were sharing pieces of code in a unique way.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This interest grew further through computer magazines and experimenting as &#8220;there was always something new to learn.” Although sport became a big part of Juan’s life in his teens, he kept up his computer learning. Taking a new direction, he found online tutorials enabling him to learn how to play the guitar. This led to setting up a punk rock band with his friends.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Education has always been important in my family, and thanks to my parent’s efforts, I attended a school where I learned to express myself in another language.” The school had hired a satellite internet connection in the mid-nineties and had HTML on the computer studies program. These facilities were not that common in Argentina or many other countries either at that time. Also, his parents had the foresight to secure a rare internet connection at the house in 1997. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Juan recalled: “Browsing around the Internet opened a new universe in my mind. This new universe was extremely fantastic but also extremely expensive. I needed to make the most of every second online.”<br><br>“It was a whole new world and one thing led to the other. I started learning a bit of everything, editing graphics, scripting and so on. I still remember my first website in the fantastic sunset strip, Geocities.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Trying to go pro</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>After high school, Juan moved to the city along with his brother and began to study IT at University. When he was asked by a friend to work at a software company, he decided to try that whilst continuing his studies. Through his job he had the chance to explore web-related opportunities, and with a friend from university, they started managing teams and projects across Latin America and Spain.<br><br>Juan describes this experience as one of the most fulfilling in his life. He was able to travel abroad for work, experience remote working, manage teams, present projects and speak formally in front of senior people. As the company grew at a fast pace, they learned how to set up and run a large organization. Eventually, he decided to drop out of his university program and focus on the opportunity of learning first hand.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/juanfra.jpg?resize=600%2C600&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Juan riding a bicycle in a historical city during his travels\" class=\"wp-image-12509\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/juanfra.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/juanfra.jpg?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/juanfra.jpg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the key early learning from working internationally was that business and web development could be just as fast-moving and successful in Argentina as in other places. “I realized there’s no such thing as a secret sauce for success. Projects are backed by people’s talent and time, and you can find that in any latitude.”<br><br>By his mid-20s, Juan decided he wanted to try building something from scratch. He created a social network for photo sharing in Latin America, which was used by more than 30,000 people across Latin America and Spain in its time. Through this, he discovered that other people had a blog and he did not want to be left behind. The discovery of WordPress was to change the focus of his life.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Hello to WordPress</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Spending some time traveling around Europe, Juan found himself ‘surrounded by uncertainty’ and worried about what the future could bring. “I had some clues, but under uncertainty, the more you ask the less you answer. I started thinking about embracing the following philosophy: I didn’t want to be part of a large company, I didn’t want to continue studying and I wanted to travel as much as I could.” He did not realize at that time how this vision for his life was to mirror what he would find in WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He started using WordPress for a few sites in 2005. By 2007 he was using it for almost everything. He was struck by the magnitude and range of what the software could do, from a simple tool used to create a blog in the blink of an eye through to complex projects.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>His first problem-solving project was simple and saved data received through a contact form plugin. “To complete this project I discovered the Codex and I learned how easy and intuitive it is to create a plugin. I had fallen in love with WordPress.”</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>I was truly amazed by how I could learn from others.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>As he explored the options with the software, Juan was unsure of how intellectual property worked and wanted to be respectful of other people’s work. “I didn’t understand open source yet, and I wasn’t sure if I was stealing from others. That was my first interaction with GPL and open source. I was truly amazed by how I could learn from others and improve things created by others or by myself.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He realized: “WordPress was the way to go if I wanted to pursue a dream of traveling, skipping winter, and working at the same time; what we now call a digital nomad. I already knew how to work remotely, I could work for companies located anywhere, as long as they could communicate in English or Spanish.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Juan started his own web agency, where he provided services to small and medium-sized companies abroad in the USA, UK, and Australia. He built his reputation and developed strong relationships in WordPress. “The experience couldn’t be better. I was learning, having fun, making a living out of it, and at the same time exploring the world.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In mid-2012, he discovered the full power of the WordPress community firsthand. In his spare time he started developing themes and from all he heard, wanted to attend a major event with lots of others in WordPress, a WordCamp. He took the plunge and booked for WordCamp in Edinburgh, in the UK. He said: “I got to meet many super talented people, and the atmosphere of the event was awesome. A place where competitors were also colleagues. Seeing the humility of somebody like Mike Little, the co-founder of WordPress, was amazing.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He added: “While there, unconsciously, I started dreaming of holding something like that in Argentina &#8211; the joy of hosting the WordPress community in my home country.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Back home, while browsing the Codex, he happened to see that WordPress was turning 10. A lot of meetups were going to be organized worldwide to celebrate the birthday. But there was nothing organized in Argentina. This was a catalyst for starting a local meetup. Together with a colleague, he&nbsp; organized an Argentinian 10th birthday meetup. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>More than 20 people showed up. “There was a common denominator. We all loved WordPress, it was part of our day-to-day life. We wanted to share experiences, make new friends and continue growing from what we could learn from others. That day we were a group of people with shared interests. That’s the simplest way to define a community, isn’t it?” This early meetup led to the formation of what is now called <a href=\"http://wpargentina.org/\">WordPress Argentina</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In his desire to skip winters and do more traveling, his next adventure was to take him to visit family working in the US and attend one of the biggest WordCamps in the world in San Francisco. His interest kept growing and he traveled across Europe to be part of the first edition of WordCamp Europe in the Netherlands in 2013.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He said: “There’s almost nothing I could write to fully express what you experience in such events. They are the main WordPress events worldwide. The best part: I made a lot of good friends from many different places. I’m glad I have more excuses to continue traveling.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once again in Argentina, our organization started growing thanks to the energy of the whole group, we started hosting formal meetups. In May 2015, we crowned all these efforts with a new <a href=\"https://buenosaires.wordcamp.org/2015/\">WordCamp in Buenos Aires</a>, Argentina.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/Juanfra-WCBA15-51.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Juan speaking at WordCamp Buenos Aires\" class=\"wp-image-12528\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/Juanfra-WCBA15-51-scaled.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/Juanfra-WCBA15-51-scaled.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/Juanfra-WCBA15-51-scaled.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/Juanfra-WCBA15-51-scaled.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/Juanfra-WCBA15-51-scaled.jpg?resize=2048%2C1365&amp;ssl=1 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>“Organizing such an event in my home country with many of the contributors I had met from the very first meetup was an experience I will always keep with me.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Juan believes one of his biggest contributions to open source was as part of being able to expand the community in Argentina and to share this with other Latin American and Spanish speaking countries. He also contributes as a volunteer translator in the Polyglots Team, to the Make WordPress Support team, and contributes to code blocks and Gutenberg. “I am really excited about seeing the future of Gutenberg as it is the future of WordPress.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Throughout his time contributing, Juan believes in helping to set the foundations and encouraging others to give their time and talents. He is keen to share that contributing does not have to be the same all the time and that you can have breaks and focus on one area in a particular period too. He gives the example of how in his spare time he watches Trac, where tickets about the software are logged, and looks where he might be able to help or think of solutions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He said: “Anytime I find I can contribute to or make improvements in code-related areas, I will do as it is important to keep giving to the community. I enjoy crawling over meta, trac, GitHub and the different places that are requesting help. There is always somewhere you can help. At the moment, my focus is code and translations. I always try to save time to help these two areas. It is like you give and you get, you learn things. You meet amazing people and opportunities arrive.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Finding your path in WordPress</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/Juanfra_1505.jpeg?resize=768%2C1024&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Juan sat in a street cafe surrounded by parked motorcycles\" class=\"wp-image-12527\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/Juanfra_1505-scaled.jpeg?resize=768%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/Juanfra_1505-scaled.jpeg?resize=225%2C300&amp;ssl=1 225w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/Juanfra_1505-scaled.jpeg?resize=1152%2C1536&amp;ssl=1 1152w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/Juanfra_1505-scaled.jpeg?resize=1536%2C2048&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/Juanfra_1505-scaled.jpeg?w=1920&amp;ssl=1 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>“Life is about experiences, it is about the people you surround yourself with and trying to do what you love. What you can find in an open source project like WordPress is an environment full of people who work with a tool they love. An environment that is ready to help and to give advice. Follow what makes you happy, try to be surrounded by people who make you better, try to empower others, try to give back. Try.

I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, we&#8217;re talking about who WordPress is built for. I was talking to a group of contributors last week and we encountered some questions around just who WordPress is built for. And it&#8217;s a question that you&#8217;ll find any time that you&#8217;re working on user testing or on triaging tickets, and especially when that comes up when you look at the big picture, roadmap sorts of things. The easiest answer for this question is, of course, everyone because WordPress&#8217; mission is to democratize publishing and that should be available to everyone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong><strong>[00:01:11]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, everyone is a really big target and certainly doesn&#8217;t help get your mind around the people that you&#8217;re wanting to actually build it for, the people that you actually want to be able to use your product, your software on a day-to-day basis. So let&#8217;s take a look at the one question that can help us figure out who it&#8217;s built for today and how we get it to being something that&#8217;s built forever.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Firstly, there&#8217;s a basic premise of open source that informs this thought. And that premise is that we are citizens of a community of contributors therefore the decisions are made by the people who show up. In general, I believe that to be true, though, I also believe that some basic qualifications are needed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:01:50]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So with that in mind, the one question that can help us figure out who a software is built for is this: how do your active contributors see themselves? I would bet that most contributors to open source software projects, like WordPress, are developers of some sort, it is sort of written right into the definition of the project.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you work on software, then you need developers. And what I love about WordPress, in particular, is that we do work to include contributors who are not developers. Yet it still remains true that there is a fairly high level of technical knowledge required to actively contribute.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:2:25]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Which kind of brings us to the second half of the original question of how can we make sure that WordPress can be something that&#8217;s built for everyone? The answer to this one is easy to say, hard to do, and that is to make sure to include them as co-creators in the development process.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;ve talked about co-creators in open source before. It&#8217;s this idea that people who use the software every day are likely to know the biggest pain points. So if you want your software to be used by people who don&#8217;t know HTML, talk to a bunch of people who don&#8217;t know HTML about how it is to use your software.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want your software to be mostly used by enterprise agencies, talk to enterprise agencies, but also ask them what their clients hate, because everyone has more than one stakeholder. And I know that I said this already, but it bears repeating that, obviously, this is all very easy to say and hard to do.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:3:20]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what is my best guess for the how-to-do part for WordPress? There are three things.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first is testing. This not only helps bring in new contributors and helps train future contributors, which I&#8217;ve talked about on the podcast before. But testing also gives us a higher chance of actionable feedback from folks who don&#8217;t necessarily spend time directly in the WordPress project.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Frequently the feedback that we do get that is just kind of undirected and ad hoc is exactly that– it is undirected and ad hoc and is then hard to follow up on and make sure that we understand what was wrong and how we can help fix it. And so testing is important for that. And testing it turns out is important for a bunch of things. When you&#8217;re working in open source.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The next thing is support. So checking in with support teams at hosts, as well as the hardworking support teams in the project. And that can really help us to get early indications of what difficulties exist now. They have routinely seen problems and issues that are raised in support forums, and from their everyday users that they are providing support to.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That probably could be fixed in WordPress if we had a good understanding of just what was not going right, how many people really needed it to go better, and what our targets were to fix that particular problem.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:4:45]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the third thing is communication. I know that I&#8217;ve gone on record in many places as saying that most of our problems at the end of the day are communication problems. And I&#8217;m going on record about it again here in this podcast, establishing better communication patterns with users is key.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That can be a multi-year project in itself. And even after that, it&#8217;s going to be an ongoing journey. But it is one of the many things that WordCamps and other WordPress events have given to us over the years, an opportunity to really hear from and see the struggles that people who are not building with WordPress every day, or literally building WordPress every day are actually having.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:5:34]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So now that you&#8217;ve heard my small list of way too big things, that brings us to our regular small list of big things. The first thing is that WordCamp Europe is still looking for volunteers. If you&#8217;ve never done that before, I think it&#8217;s quite fun. You get to meet a lot of people and the team of organizers is super fun, but I&#8217;ll leave a link for you in the show notes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also have a new code-free way to contribute through the photo directory. That team is just getting started and still is working toward building out its programs. So now&#8217;s a good time to drop in and just kind of see what they are up to. And finally, a reminder that we do have contributors who are affected by the war in Ukraine right now. I will reshare the list of humanitarian organizations in case you missed them a couple of weeks ago as well.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:6:21]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that my friends is your small list of big things. Thank you for tuning in today for this WordPress Briefing. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. I&#8217;ll see you again in a couple of weeks.</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"12451\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:28;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:63:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n		\n		\n\n					\n										\n					\n		\n		\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:6:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:48:\"WordPress 5.9.2 Security and Maintenance Release\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:80:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2022/03/wordpress-5-9-2-security-maintenance-release/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 11 Mar 2022 02:24:13 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:3:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"Releases\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"Security\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:2;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3:\"5.9\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=12421\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:367:\"WordPress 5.9.2&#160;is now available!

I have Matt here with me today because we want to acknowledge that we are once again at the start of a very difficult time. Neither of us would presume to know what it&#8217;s like to be at the heart of such massive disruption in our lives. But who would we be if we didn&#8217;t stop and check in with you all, the project that we hold so dear? And with that, I&#8217;ll hand it right over to you, Matt.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Matt Mullenweg&nbsp; </strong>00:27</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hello everyone. First, I want to thank Josepha for inviting me to join the WordPress Briefing to share what’s been on my mind in light of recent global events.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Matt Mullenweg&nbsp; </strong>00:37</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve been listening and watching events escalate in Ukraine, often in a state of shock. The scale alone is hard to take in. I mean, in the last 7 days, more than 500,000 people have fled their homes, more refugees are expected every day. The downstream humanitarian crises of the invasion are unimaginable.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Matt Mullenweg&nbsp; </strong>00:56</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And seeing destruction in the world we live in is confusing, disconcerting, and difficult. In my experience, open source and WordPress bring people together; people from other countries and cultures, people that we know as friends and colleagues. Technology connects us, regardless of where we are. Nothing can negate the bad things happening in the world, but when I see how this community of contributors collaborates, regardless of borders, you all remind me of the good in the world every day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Matt Mullenweg&nbsp; </strong>01:30</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I firmly believe that the web can be an equalizer and a force for good in the world. To me, the WordPress project is the epitome of goodness—everyone has a voice, a platform, and a community. You have the power to make your corner of the world, and the web, a sanctuary for those who need it—especially now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Matt Mullenweg&nbsp; </strong>01:45</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you or someone you know is affected by this war, I encourage you to be present as the ramifications unfold. While we may all feel fatigued and have a sense of languishing from the past two years of the Covid pandemic, the gift of time and support for one another cannot be overstated. I&#8217;m confident that every single person in the WordPress community will approach the situation in Ukraine with sensitivity and understanding.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Matt Mullenweg&nbsp; </strong>02:07</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I invite you to join me in standing with those in the world working to end conflict and working toward a world of peace, promise, and opportunity. If you&#8217;re looking for a way to help support the humanitarian crisis in Ukraine, I will offer some suggested NGOs, or Non-Governmental Organizations, that provide assistance to local peacebuilders in the region.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Matt Mullenweg&nbsp; </strong>02:26</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In closing, please know that my thoughts are with everyone in our community. I know that my words here can’t change anything there, but I hope that we all remember that words of support are never unwelcome. And we can never know when a little human kindness can help someone share the invisible heaviness in their heart.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>02:44</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks for that, Matt. My friends, there are links in the show notes to some of the groups that Matt referenced. And that is it for this special edition of the WordPress Briefing. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Be safe, be kind to yourself and others, and I&#8217;ll see you again in a couple of weeks.</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"12415\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}}}s:27:\"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom\";a:1:{s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:0:\"\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:3:{s:4:\"href\";s:32:\"https://wordpress.org/news/feed/\";s:3:\"rel\";s:4:\"self\";s:4:\"type\";s:19:\"application/rss+xml\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:44:\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/syndication/\";a:2:{s:12:\"updatePeriod\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:9:\"\n	hourly	\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:15:\"updateFrequency\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4:\"\n	1	\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:4:\"site\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"14607090\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}}}}}}}}s:4:\"type\";i:128;s:7:\"headers\";O:42:\"Requests_Utility_CaseInsensitiveDictionary\":1:{s:7:\"\0*\0data\";a:9:{s:6:\"server\";s:5:\"nginx\";s:4:\"date\";s:29:\"Sat, 16 Jul 2022 06:43:49 GMT\";s:12:\"content-type\";s:34:\"application/rss+xml; charset=UTF-8\";s:25:\"strict-transport-security\";s:11:\"max-age=360\";s:6:\"x-olaf\";s:3:\"⛄\";s:13:\"last-modified\";s:29:\"Wed, 13 Jul 2022 13:46:40 GMT\";s:4:\"link\";s:63:\"<https://wordpress.org/news/wp-json/>; rel=\"https://api.w.org/\"\";s:15:\"x-frame-options\";s:10:\"SAMEORIGIN\";s:4:\"x-nc\";s:9:\"HIT ord 1\";}}s:5:\"build\";s:14:\"20220716062202\";}', 'no');

The event is gaining momentum as organizers were selected earlier this year and the call for sponsors opened last month. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Asia&#8217;s inaugural flagship WordCamp will be hosted February 17-19, at IconSiam in Bangkok Thailand with 1,500 attendees expected. It kicks off with a contributor day followed by two conference days.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Organizers have now <a href=\"https://asia.wordcamp.org/2023/call-for-speakers/\">opened the call for speakers</a> and are looking for &#8220;diverse topics and inspirational stories.&#8221; Prospective speakers who need some inspiration may browse suggested topics, which include everything from development to careers and marketing. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like many other WordCamps, this event will include long talks (30 minutes plus Q&amp;A) and lightning talks (10 minutes and no Q&amp;A). The schedule will have each long talk in its own hour slot with a 15-minute break between sessions for networking. All sessions will be conducted in English this year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordCamp Asia&#8217;s organizers made it clear that they do not intend to approve first-time or inexperienced speakers. A demonstration of prior speaking experience is required. Speakers will need to include at least one video link to a previous talk in their applications. For those who have never spoken at a WordPress event, the organizers recommend applicants get some practice at a local meetup or an <a href=\"https://central.wordcamp.org/schedule/\">upcoming WordCamp</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Organizers are not planning to host any workshops at this time but may open a separate call for workshops if the situation changes. The speaker application deadline is September 15, 2022, and selection announcements will begin November 15, 2022.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sat, 16 Jul 2022 02:45:40 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:1;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:42:\"Post Status: Market Size and Market Shares\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:32:\"https://poststatus.com/?p=101579\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:57:\"https://cdn.poststatus.com/market-size-and-market-shares/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:250:\"$635 billion…That’s \"billion,\" with a “B.” Let\'s look at the size of the universe inhabited by our market of markets, the WordPress ecosystem.

Meta contributors added a new &#8220;<a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/tags/full-site-editing/\">Block Themes</a>&#8221; menu item to the filter menu on the directory homepage, a solution that some classic theme developers <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-themes-team-contributors-get-pushback-on-proposal-to-improve-block-themes-visibility-in-the-directory\">fought tooth and nail to discourage</a> in the ticket over the course of seven weeks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Clicking on Block Themes displays themes that have the <code>full-site-editing</code>&nbsp;feature tag. Previously, block themes were buried three clicks deep and users had to know how to find them through the feature filter. They are now easily accessible from the directory landing page. </p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>Although most WordPress themes support blocks in the content editor, the &#8220;block themes&#8221; identifier refers to themes that allow users to edit templates with blocks through the Site Editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the landscape of themes is changing, contributors have been working towards building a shared lexicon for how they refer to themes that support full-site editing. When the team updated the Theme Handbook prior to the WordPress 5.9 release, they settled on using the term &#8220;classic&#8221; for PHP-based themes and &#8220;block&#8221; for those that support full-site editing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Block themes are about to cross a major milestone in the directory. At the time of publishing there are 99 block themes available, representing roughly 1% of the directory&#8217;s total number of themes. As part of the project’s <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/project/2022/01/21/big-picture-goals-2022/\">big picture goals for 2022</a>, WordPress Executive Director Josepha Haden-Chomphosy set 500 block themes as a goal for the community. The number is not even halfway there but the newly released <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-themes-team-releases-new-plugin-for-creating-block-themes\">Create Block Theme</a> plugin should give it a boost, as it allows anyone to design a theme in the editor and export it for others to use.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 15 Jul 2022 20:18:08 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:3;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:141:\"Post Status: WordPress Certifications, SVG Uploads, FSE Category Testing, Fornightly NPM updates, Persistent Object Cache and Full Page Cache\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:32:\"https://poststatus.com/?p=101531\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:148:\"https://poststatus.com/wordpress-certifications-svg-uploads-fse-category-testing-fornightly-npm-updates-persistent-object-cache-and-full-page-cache/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:107:\"What are your thoughts about WordPress certification?

In six years, the software has undergone a metamorphosis by adopting a new block paradigm that should be reflected in its website. Contributors are now looking at giving the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/\">homepage</a> and <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/download/\">download page</a> a design overhaul that showcases its new capabilities. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Since then, WordPress has seen a lot of changes, including the Gutenberg editor, Full Site Editor, block themes, and more,&#8221; Automattic-sponsored marketing team rep Nicholas Garofalo said. &#8220;All of these have revolutionized WordPress in the past few years, and the brand is starting to modernize and evolve as well.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Earlier this year WordPress.org <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-news-gets-a-new-design\">launched design updates for the news</a> and <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/design/2021/10/29/redesign-of-the-gutenberg-page/\">Gutenberg</a> pages. &#8220;There’s a ton of room to expand and evolve this look as we turn our attention to other parts of the site,&#8221; Garofalo said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The designers working on the project are particularly interested in hearing from WordPress.org users about what they want to see on the homepage, which means everyday users are welcome to contribute their thoughts and suggestions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Download page <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20210106091723/https://wordpress.org/download/\">used to prominently feature the download button at the top of the page</a>, but sometime in mid-January 2021, it was pushed further down below recommended hosts. This was presumably to help people who want to set up a self-hosted site but don’t know where to get started but doesn&#8217;t make sense for those who came there to download the software. A transparent approach to redesigning this page would be appreciated, as changes like this are not always publicly documented. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So far, only a handful of full-time contributors have weighed in on the upcoming redesign in the comments of the post.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I’d love to see the design showcase the modernization of the site editor and layout capabilities – even going so far as to do things many haven’t seen before, while also taking a moment to use words to describe why WordPress is so important in site-building,&#8221; Automattic-sponsored marketing contributor Dan Soschin said. &#8220;It provides freedom, empowerment, and democracy in publishing. And what’s more, you can be technical or not technical, and still achieve all your goals.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Soschin also suggested that the Download page offer more of an explanation on what it takes to self-host WordPress by either posting steps or directing visitors to guides and resources. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Automattic-sponsored design team contributor Javier Arce had a unique idea of making the page with patterns in sections that users can copy and paste into their own websites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Since the website is made using WordPress and it’ll have a refreshed and modern look, I think it would be very cool not only to advertise that fact (&#8216;hey, so this fantastic site you are on right now was made entirely with the software you came here to download!&#8217;)… but also to allow people to grab the patterns used for each section… maybe even from the page itself, in a sort of self-referential nod to the platform,&#8221; Arce said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Several contributors commented requesting the homepage highlight the community, &#8220;since the vibrant, active WP community is such a huge differentiator,&#8221; Automattic-sponsored marketing contributor Jonathan Pantani said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Aside from the power of the software itself and what it can do, there’s the whole community of people that have been coming together regularly to share in a movement,&#8221; Automattic-sponsored marketing contributor Lauren Stein said. &#8220;This currently feels like it’s downplayed. I think it would be wonderful if it were highlighted more.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This project needs more diverse input from contributors across the ecosystem and regular WordPress users who visit the website.

Performance team contributor Manuel Rodriguez detailed a few ways to use the filters:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Hosts may want to replace the notes to recommend their preferred object caching solution.</li><li>Hosts may want to replace the original link to WordPress documentation with a link to  their own guide.</li><li>Hosts or site owners may want to bypass thresholds and force suggestions, or filter them to determine whether to suggest the use of a persistent object cache.</li><li>Developers can filter the threshold below which a response time is considered good.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The team is targeting WordPress 6.1 for merging the modules into core. The proposed modules are just two of many more planned enhancements and improvements to <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/performance/labels/%5BFocus%5D%20Site%20Health\">Site Health audits and reports</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 14 Jul 2022 17:42:16 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:8;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:85:\"Do The Woo Community: A WooCommerce Migration and Multisite Case Study with Multidots\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"https://dothewoo.io/?p=72408\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:70:\"https://dothewoo.io/a-woocommerce-migration-case-study-with-multidots/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:424:\"<p>Multiple sites and over 3k users, Aslam, Ajay and Chirag walk us through this challenging project with RHRSwag.com</p>\n<p>&gt;&gt; The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://dothewoo.io/a-woocommerce-migration-case-study-with-multidots/\">A WooCommerce Migration and Multisite Case Study with Multidots</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://dothewoo.io\">Do the Woo - a WooCommerce Builder Community</a>	.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 14 Jul 2022 09:32:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"BobWP\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:9;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:82:\"WPTavern: Axton: A Free Block-based Portfolio Theme with Full-Site Editing Support\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=136100\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:92:\"https://wptavern.com/axton-a-free-block-based-portfolio-theme-with-full-site-editing-support\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3017:\"<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/axton/\">Axton</a> is a beautiful new addition to the WordPress Themes Directory from the team at <a href=\"https://catchthemes.com/\">Catch Themes</a>. Those who have been waiting for more full-site editing-enabled themes that go beyond a simple blogging layout should have a look at Axton, as it  is suitable for a portfolio, photography showcase, or even a business website. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The theme boasts more than 15 block patterns, 17 full-site editing (FSE) templates, and nine template parts. Users can showcase their work with Header media, Hero Content, and Featured Content patterns anywhere on the site. </p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>The entirety of the <a href=\"https://fse.catchthemes.com/axton/\">theme&#8217;s demo</a> site is available in pieces as patterns, so users can drag and drop and mix and match them to suit their needs. Even the style guide can be placed in the content via a pattern. Axton&#8217;s header is also available as the &#8220;Header with Search Bar&#8221; pattern that places the blocks in a pre-designed arrangement that is perfectly responsive on different device sizes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After activating the theme, the Customize button launches the Site Editor with a homepage that nearly matches the demo so that users don&#8217;t have to start from a blank slate. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some layout options that users might previously have implemented via a page template prior to FSE, are now available as customizable patterns. For example, Axton offers &#8220;Blog Sidebar on Left&#8221; and &#8220;Blog Sidebar on Right&#8221; patterns that can be placed within a template and users can easily manipulate the alignments, background color, typography, and more </p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>The &#8220;Contact Us&#8221; pattern works with the Contact Form 7 plugin. Users are prompted to install it after placing the pattern.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>Axton includes 17 full-site editing templates and nine template parts that enable users to quickly make changes to the layouts of the front page, single posts, the blog page, search results, and more. It also includes a Blank template for a clean slate when creating completely custom pages.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, Axton is a beautifully designed theme that gives users a strong starting point for launching a portfolio or business website with more flexibility and template options than most sites will ever need. Catch Themes also has a Pro plugin that includes custom blocks for a Case Study, Popup Video, Tabs, Masonry, Header Search, and a Skills Bar, along with advanced patterns like pricing tables, logo display, and testimonials.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Check out the <a href=\"https://catchthemes.com/themes/axton/#theme-instructions\">documentation</a> on the Catch Themes website for a tour of how to use the theme&#8217;s features. <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/axton/\">Axton</a> is available for free from the WordPress Themes Directory.

How are you doing?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:59] <strong>Felix Arntz:</strong> Pretty great. It&#8217;s amazing to be back at the in person event. It&#8217;s crazy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:03] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> There are 2000, I think 2,700 people and it actually feels like a lot more, but it&#8217;s a spectacular event.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You are working at Google. Am I right in saying that? What&#8217;s your role over at Google?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:13] <strong>Felix Arntz:</strong> I&#8217;m a developer relations engineer, so yeah, I work on specifically focused on content management systems. Like of course WordPress, primarily. So yeah, I&#8217;m working in the, primarily in the WordPress ecosystem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:25] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:25] <strong>Felix Arntz:</strong> And, my two main projects currently are the Site Kit plugin, Google Site Kit plugin, which is, you may have heard of. It&#8217;s Google&#8217;s flagship plugin for WordPress and the new performance team, which was fairly recently formed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:36] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Did you have a background in WordPress or were you Google first and then WordPress a bit later? Or was it WordPress first and Google later?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:42] <strong>Felix Arntz:</strong> I come from the WordPress community. My first WordCamp was WordCamp Europe seven years ago, and then I joined the contributor day and I got to contribute and really got hooked on doing that. I got my first props for WordPress Core contributions back then, and I never stopped contributing since.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:59] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> It, kind of feels like if you were to rewind the clock that far, maybe a bit further, that Google and WordPress, there wasn&#8217;t really a connection there. it was one of many CMSs, but maybe I&#8217;ve got the timeline wrong there, but it does feel now as if Google is treating WordPress very seriously indeed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, obviously with the market share being what it is, it&#8217;s good to get in there. Is that the case? Does it see WordPress as an important part of the ecosystem?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:23] <strong>Felix Arntz:</strong> Yeah, absolutely. I think historically it&#8217;s, it has not always been as much as that, as it has been since, I don&#8217;t know, 2017, 18, I think that&#8217;s where this really started. And yeah, that&#8217;s where Google started actively focusing more on WordPress. There had been smaller efforts here and there before, but that&#8217;s when it really started. And I started working for Google in the end of 2018, and with a few other people from the WordPress community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:46] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Well, your involvement in WordCamp Europe is all about performance and, I would imagine most people, and I&#8217;m gonna say that me included basically, I don&#8217;t really understand it. I know that it&#8217;s important. I know that performance matters, and I know that everybody is, has been talking about it for the last, let&#8217;s say eighteen, twenty months, specifically around Core Web Vitals and things like that, where we, we suddenly felt like the sky was falling in and everything needed to be rebuilt.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>How important, does it really matter? And what I mean by that is if I&#8217;m just starting up a local website for a local shop and I can sort of rely on traffic to come to that website. Does it have any impact at all, or is this really just about the search engine? The search results for Google? So I&#8217;m trying to strike a balance with where we need to apply the most effort. So for most people it would be designing the website in the first place and things like SEO possibly, and performance possibly they come much further down the pecking order of what they want to worry about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What&#8217;s your insight? Is it super important or is it a thing that we can leave till a little bit later?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:47] <strong>Felix Arntz:</strong> I would say that performance and SEO have a little bit of similarity just in the sense that they both actually affect, they should affect, user experience. The end user experience of the people that visit the site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So search engine optimization in that sense is a little bit of a misleading term I would argue, because of course you are optimizing for the search engine, but the search engines, the different search engines, they try to be, they try to have algorithms that as close as possible kind of represent how the user would experience the site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And when you optimize for search engines, if you do it in the proper way you would also be optimizing for the end users. There&#8217;s of course those things like black hat SEO, where you stuff keywords, and that doesn&#8217;t do anything nice for end user. And that&#8217;s the way that you should not do SEO.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And when you do improved performance, it now has, yeah, it has certain impact on the search engines, but mainly it is a priority because of the end user experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:41] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Okay. So, this is a ridiculous question, but I&#8217;m gonna ask it anyway. What are the key bits, what are the key bits of the jigsaw that make up performance? If you were to put yourself in front of a typical WordPress user. So somebody who basically doesn&#8217;t really perhaps know anything about performance, what would be the things that you would say, okay, here&#8217;s the first two or three things that you need to be worrying about?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:02] <strong>Felix Arntz:</strong> I feel like at a high level a lot of people think about performance, just about how fast the page loads. That is probably, maybe the most essential of the different high level areas of what is performance. But I think it&#8217;s also, it is very important to, there&#8217;s two other, I would argue high level aspects, which are key for performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I take performance again, in that sense, it&#8217;s a, it&#8217;s a major part of user experience. Another part of it is layout shifts. So I feel like everybody that&#8217;s probably listening to this has experienced this thing that they click on a button on a website and it, while they want to click the moment it clicks, it moves away and then you click on some ad instead or something like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:40] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Maybe by design.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:41] <strong>Felix Arntz:</strong> Maybe yeah, yeah, sometimes. But yeah, this is a very bad user experience and not having this kind of experience is also contributing to a solid performance. I would really put performance to a degree similar with user experience. It&#8217;s a part of user experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The third part to performance is how fast the page responds when you do something on it. If you scroll and it&#8217;s, if you move the scroll wheel and it scrolls four seconds later, that&#8217;s not great either. So those are the three tiers to performance, in my opinion. Like the loading performance, the avoiding layout shifts and how fast the page responds to your actions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:15] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> The beautiful thing about WordPress is that you can download WordPress and it basically comes vanilla. And you can throw as many things as you like on top of it, plugin, themes, blocks, increasingly and so on. And of course, each of those things has a, perhaps tiny, but maybe major impact.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I feel that it&#8217;s quite a difficult thing to understand in WordPress, what performance is. If you go to, and we&#8217;ll get onto this, we&#8217;ll develop this a bit later. If you go to a proprietary CMS, something where it&#8217;s a SaaS. You pay your fixed monthly fee or what have you, and they take care of all of that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s nothing to worry about, but it seems like there&#8217;s a myriad of things, possibly dozens of things that you could do to your WordPress site. I feel that that&#8217;s a difficulty. That&#8217;s a problem that WordPress has got to overcome because there&#8217;s no one size fits all. No two WordPress sites are the same.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it&#8217;s that puzzle of unpicking. Okay, on my site, what are the things that I need to do to address it? Do you think that is an actual problem? Have we got ourselves to the point where WordPress is, because of its nature, because you can throw anything at it. It&#8217;s more difficult to untangle that mess?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:16] <strong>Felix Arntz:</strong> Certainly yes. So I would say by the nature of WordPress that, because there&#8217;s endless possibilities. There&#8217;s endless possibilities to do whatever you want to do, but, there&#8217;s also endless possibilities to mess up performance or any, any best practice for that matter on your WordPress site, because you kind of have full control about everything.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In those other type of platforms, which like SaaS or proprietary or whatever you call them, yeah it&#8217;s all, it&#8217;s more controlled. It is a more controlled environment. You have a lot less options in what you can do. And another aspect is that in those systems, they&#8217;re usually maintained by a single company and that company builds the entire product. All the different aspects of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Where in the WordPress ecosystem, there&#8217;s WordPress core. And then there&#8217;s 60,000 plugins, from probably 50,000 different people or companies. So they are not all aligned. I can tell you that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:08] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> It does make it incredibly difficult to unpick because your combination of things will not be the same as my combination of things. And whilst there might be some broad outlines that you can do. And, I feel that in the WordPress space, a lot of that is sort of installing another thing to try and unpick all the other things that you did. So it might be a performance or a caching plugin or something like that, and the problem sort of gets worse.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And although at this event, WordCamp Europe 2022, I would say it&#8217;s fair to say that most of the people here are fairly obsessed with WordPress. I would also hazard a guess that the vast majority of people that are using WordPress, have very little idea of what&#8217;s going on. You know, they, they probably know there&#8217;s some hosting accounts somewhere that they&#8217;ve used and whatever that tier is and so on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And they know that they&#8217;re using WordPress, but they might not have any, any indication that, okay, you, you need to compress this, cache this and so on. And that&#8217;s, that&#8217;s difficult. And communicating that to people I think is gonna be a real challenge for wordpress.org in the future because the competition from the proprietary CMSs, the ones that you say where everything&#8217;s in one package. It&#8217;s hosted by them. It&#8217;s managed by them. The code is updated by them. They feel at the moment as if they&#8217;re kind of winning the race a little bit in terms of performance. Is that fair?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:19] <strong>Felix Arntz:</strong> Yeah, like some of those, proprietary CMSs, they are indeed ahead of WordPress in terms of performance, but largely due to them having less of this complexity that we are facing with WordPress. But also not only WordPress, like other open source CMSs, like Drupal, Joomla and so forth, they are facing similar challenges.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:37] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So the next piece for me is the approach that WordPress has taken. And a few years ago it was decided that performance was enough of a thing that a team need needed to be created. And my understanding is that you are part of that team. What&#8217;s its remit? What&#8217;s its objectives? What&#8217;s its goal? And I realize that you&#8217;re at the beginning of this journey. So it may be that you&#8217;re just trying to flesh out what that looks like. But just give us an idea of what it is, what the goals are and how many people are involved at this point in time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:03] <strong>Felix Arntz:</strong> So the team actually only came up in fall or so last year. Probably the early conversation started sometime summer last. It was an initiative that came from different contributors. Several, like the way that usually WordPress teams, new WordPress teams are formed is that a group of people or people from companies or individual contributors get together and say, we need to do something about this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Specifically in this, me and other people from my team were involved in together with contributors from Yoast and XWP, 10up, we all kind of got together and thought like, we need to do something about performance. Started in through initial conversations and at some point we formed a proposal that we published at makewordpress.org that there should be an official WordPress performance team that can focus on those aspects.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is an accessibility team. There&#8217;s a security team. There should also be a performance team. And as similar to those other two teams, to really have a focus group for this area, that goes across the different disciplines. Like not only Core, but also plugins and themes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s how the performance team started. It has been very well received from the very beginning. Uh, there was a lot of support on the initial posts. That was amazing to see that a lot of people in the WordPress community, they were happy to see that and they cared.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since then, yeah, I would say the team&#8217;s formation so far has been quite successful. We started, setting up weekly meetings on Slack where we discussed where we&#8217;re gonna focus on. And a lot of contributors have showed up since, and contributed to our efforts, to the team&#8217;s efforts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:33] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> And I presume you&#8217;re wide open to anybody that&#8217;s listening to this that wants to get stuck in as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:38] <strong>Felix Arntz:</strong> Oh, absolutely. We have a booth here at WordCamp Europe, which is also really exciting, like at the community area there&#8217;s a performance booth this time and we would love to have anybody who&#8217;s interested to join our meetings</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:50] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Tell me how it&#8217;s been received. There&#8217;s all the other booths as well. Have you been receiving the same amount of visitors coming to you and talking and trying to figure things out?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:58] <strong>Felix Arntz:</strong> Yeah, there has been a large number of people that were interested in coming, stopping by asking about. And some people have heard about the initiative before and they just wanna to hear a bit more about it. Some people come with very concrete ideas, like, hey, we should do this in the performance team. Other people haven&#8217;t heard about it yet, and that&#8217;s great too. Like, so far, yeah, the reception has been very positive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:17] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So what are the ideas that you are coalescing around? What are the things that are coming up in your Slack channel and maybe that came up in the last 24 hours or so? What are the things that you&#8217;ve decided, okay, we&#8217;re gonna tackle it in this order. Here&#8217;s the first two, three, whatever things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:30] <strong>Felix Arntz:</strong> So, look at it from a higher level. I think we have with the performance team, there is different layers to improve. And the main thing that we have been focusing on so far is improving performance in WordPress Core, different aspects of WordPress Core.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s the one aspect. Another one is to, improve or to make available tools, to measure performance specifically for WordPress, in a WordPress context. Through that basically, raise more awareness or make it easier, even for plugin or theme developers to test performance of their plugins or themes and determine where there are any problems and how can those be fixed?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that&#8217;s another aspect and overall, raising more awareness of performance and making metric based performance decisions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:11] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> It feels to me like the WordPress Core bit is the low hanging fruit, because there it is. You&#8217;ve got it in front of you and you can figure out what it is that needs to be tweaked and so on. And so presumably work, whether it&#8217;s begun or not, I don&#8217;t know, but presumably work will begin on that at some point. And then as you say, it&#8217;s about educating the community and I feel that&#8217;s going quite well actually.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I obsess about WordPress and so I&#8217;m constantly looking around, but it does feel like there&#8217;s a lot more messaging about that coming out. Maybe that&#8217;s to do with Core Web Vitals and things and so on and so forth. I wondered about partnerships as well, because a big part of this whole jigsaw piece is the thing that the WordPress site sits on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So for example, you know, you may have hosting over here for $3 99 a month or something, or you may be spending a hundred dollars a month and that kind of piece presumably, would be at some point needed to be addressed. Talking to the hosting companies and so on making partnerships and giving them the benefit of whatever insights you&#8217;ve managed to figure out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:06] <strong>Felix Arntz:</strong> Absolutely. There are some people who are from the hosting team there, from the WordPress hosting team are also involved in the performance team. And, I can say not a lot has happened on that side yet, but that is certainly an aspect where we wanna do more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And we have already. So far, we&#8217;ve mostly reached out to hosting providers for specific feedback on certain things that we wanted to do in WordPress Core to get more research and more information on that. But I think what you&#8217;re saying, I definitely see that coming up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:32] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> In terms of Google&#8217;s contribution. Google traditionally over the last few years, certainly since I&#8217;ve been attending these large events, Google&#8217;s been a real key sponsor. And you&#8217;re helping with the Site Kit initiative. Just tell us about that. Maybe just dwell on the complexity of that and all of the different pieces that fit into place, because I&#8217;ve heard about it. I briefly took a look at it right at the beginning when it came out and it&#8217;s fresh and new, but I haven&#8217;t really done much with it since then. So I need educating on what&#8217;s in there and where it&#8217;s gone in the last few months or years even.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:01] <strong>Felix Arntz:</strong> So Site Kit is very much separate from the performance team. That has, has been the product which I started on, started working on from my very beginning at Google. it&#8217;s basically, Google&#8217;s, Google&#8217;s flagship product which helps you to use the popular Google tools that help you succeed as a web creator, right within your WordPress site. And one of the things that really helps with its onboarding to all those tools, like search console, analytics, AdSense to name a few.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s always this complexity that in order to set up those tools on your site, you often have to paste some snippet somewhere in your WordPress site, and then it&#8217;s like a lot of people put this in their themes&#8217; functions.php, and then you update the theme and it&#8217;s gone. Or like, unless you really know what you&#8217;re doing there, there&#8217;s lots of ways to mess that up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the things that Site Kit really does for you is make this super straightforward, like make a couple clicks and it all takes care of that for you because it&#8217;s in the WordPress site, it connects directly to the Google APIs. Sets up those those services for you. And then it displays the relevant metrics right within your WordPress site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you can manage it all from your WordPress site. You can still go to the Google services of course, to see like the full picture of all the stats, but you can see the most, what we consider the most important metrics, you can see them in your WordPress site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:07] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So it basically pulls all of the bits and pieces, all the important data from the Google properties. And just puts them inside the dashboard as if you&#8217;ve gone out to look at, I dunno, analytics dot Google dot com.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:17] <strong>Felix Arntz:</strong> Right. Yeah. One thing that is also special about it is that it has connection to all of those services. In the Google services, you have to go to one service or the other or the other, but in Site Kit has a dashboard that combines the metrics from all of them. There is definitely like a long term goal to also correlate them more. Like we have also connection to Page Speed Insights, which that is a part of Site Kit, which has more, a little bit more of course, like overlap with performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we have a page speed module and, eventually it would be amazing if we can somehow explain to site owners how like performance, this page, let&#8217;s make an example. Like this URL has a way better web vitals performance value than other ones and see how it&#8217;s much better performing in terms of the number of conversions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:01] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I feel like that&#8217;s the missing bit for me. The connection between all of this work and any benefit. Because I never see the benefit from the work, because you know, you put in the time and you, compress this thing and you do that thing, but there&#8217;s no sort of direct comparison.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If I could, for example, quickly and easily in my WordPress dashboard go, okay, that thing that I did over there, it&#8217;s been up there for a month now and I can see that it&#8217;s had this effect. Yeah. That&#8217;s really useful. It&#8217;s a great big endorsement I think from the giant that is Google to put all of this time and effort into a WordPress thing. I don&#8217;t know if you do that on other CMSs or other platforms as well?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:39] <strong>Felix Arntz:</strong> I mean, we have been involved with other CMSs, like Typo3 Drupal, Joomla. The team that I&#8217;m part of, mostly with open source, open source CMSs. WordPress has a bit more attention because of its yeah, its meaning, its importance and popularity on the web. One of the things that we are seeing is that fewer users use the traditional web, which is what WordPress is part of. And more and more users use apps and we think it&#8217;s vital that, to get a little more of this attention from people back to the web, it has to match the apps in the experience and the performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:14] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Is that what is behind all of this push because, I mean, the, the apps on your phone, they are just breathtakingly, amazing. You know, the capabilities that are in iOS and Android and the way that they behave and the animations and things. They&#8217;re just all baked into the OS and they look beautiful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I completely identify with why would you go to, as an example, why would you go to twitter.com if you could have the Twitter app? And so that, I guess is what you&#8217;re saying that at some point, parity between the two, the web is in every way as capable and performant as the app.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:44] <strong>Felix Arntz:</strong> Right, right. Yeah, absolutely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:46] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah. I feel like we&#8217;re a long way away from that at the minute.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:48] <strong>Felix Arntz:</strong> Yes we are. And that&#8217;s where, that&#8217;s why Google overall is interested in this and Google would like to succeed. Would like to see the web succeed. Cause it, of course it is important for Google, but it is also important for WordPress. So I would argue in this sense and, I care. I have always been part of the WordPress ecosystem and I, I am a fan of WordPress, otherwise I wouldn&#8217;t be here. And, uh, I think that in this sense I would argue that the interest of WordPress and Google in that sense overlap.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:13] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> It&#8217;s interesting because on my phone I&#8217;m really addicted to the way that the animation is is smooth and the way that I might scroll something up and something will compress. So there&#8217;s animations there. And yet it&#8217;s kind of like the polar opposite on the web we&#8217;re being told no, no, get rid of all of that sort of stuff. You know, compress the images don&#8217;t have any animation where you don&#8217;t need it, and so on. They are quite different things. And I guess it&#8217;s the browser, that&#8217;s the bottleneck?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:34] <strong>Felix Arntz:</strong> I don&#8217;t know. I, I would argue there&#8217;s, the more of those things you do, the harder it gets to keep good performance. Having good performance is hard. And, uh, if you have an empty WordPress site out of the box, it has amazing performance, but you add 10 plugins to it and a ton of content and that changes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:50] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> To develop that a little bit, what I was meaning is on the phone, it doesn&#8217;t seem to matter how much of those animations and things they throw at it. It still just is performant.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I, I really don&#8217;t know where the difference there is, whether the browser is incapable of handling that level of load, or if it&#8217;s just that the, the operating system, iOS, Android, or what have you you can cope more. I don&#8217;t know.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:08] <strong>Felix Arntz:</strong> I don&#8217;t know. I would argue that quite a bit of it is that, you can do a lot of those nicer animations on the web too. And, if you do it yeah, with CSS, it can still be fast. But usually there&#8217;s other things involved that make the website slow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you can do these animations with CSS, you should not try to do them with JavaScript, for example. Especially like Java, loading a lot of JavaScript is one of the prime offenders of good performance on sites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:34] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> A couple of years ago, actually, you may need to correct me. When did the whole concept of Core Web Vitals, when did that all really begin? It feels like two years to me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:42] <strong>Felix Arntz:</strong> Yeah. Maybe I, I can&#8217;t even say.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:43] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> It&#8217;s about, it&#8217;s roughly, let&#8217;s say it&#8217;s two years. Everybody was obsessed with that. It really did feel like it was a you know, line in the sound where everybody was right, if it doesn&#8217;t meet all of these metrics, hell is gonna freeze over. Your website won&#8217;t be ranked anymore. Equally, it never felt to me that that moment ever arrived. I didn&#8217;t really see that the sites that I&#8217;d been building hit too badly, even though there wasn&#8217;t a lot of remedial work that I did. Was that just a load of hype or did that stuff really affect the SERPs?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:12] <strong>Felix Arntz:</strong> I mean this was prioritized. The Core Web Vitals um, were prioritized by Google, of course, because we had to raise more awareness of that performance on the web is not going so great. And the site owners and developers and whoever is involved in websites, they should, they need to do something about it to improve performance. Honestly, I don&#8217;t know much about like how they affect search.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:32] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah. I was gonna say, if you knew how the search results were.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:35] <strong>Felix Arntz:</strong> Oh yeah. Yeah, lot of people would ask me a lot of questions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:37] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> That&#8217;s right. You&#8217;d be locked in this room and pounded by questions, yeah. You&#8217;ve managed to make a career out of WordPress and performance. So firstly, well done for that. If that&#8217;s the thing that you were aiming at, that&#8217;s really amazing. Secondly, I wonder if the whole performance thing is there like a bonafide career in the future. In the same way that people, I dunno, 20 years ago, there were no people who were SEO consultants. It was just not a thing. And then suddenly people thought, oh, do you know what, there&#8217;s a job there, there&#8217;s enough work to be done to make that a job and we can get paid for doing that. Do you think that would be the case for people like you? You could be a freelance performance person?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:13] <strong>Felix Arntz:</strong> I feel like that is already a thing to a degree. It&#8217;s probably has blurry lines, like where you are like, I would recommend that, if any developer should try to familiarize themselves with the performance best practices and build that knowledge and improve this knowledge over time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because it is important to consider performance in every, in every step while you develop your products or plugins or themes, and similar to how this with accessibility and security, they have to be part of the whole design process at all times. But I would to your point, I also can see how I think there&#8217;re already a bunch of people that, that have specific strength in their knowledge in performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And maybe they&#8217;re still developers or maybe they could also be end users that know a ton about performance and help other site owners to improve it. Yeah, I think that is already a thing. but I, I could definitely see it growing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:00] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah. It feels like a tunnel that you could go down and you could really be an expert in that and sort of separate yourself and maybe find a career which didn&#8217;t always involve, I don&#8217;t know, building the entire site. You might just advise on that particular component.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:11] <strong>Felix Arntz:</strong> Yeah Yeah. I think one of the things I wanna say, like in order to get started with that, uh, some of the tools that help you measure performance, they can be really helpful I would say. Because a lot of us, including myself, we don&#8217;t know all of these performance best practices. It is a ton to think about based on what you&#8217;re doing. Yeah, there are a lot of different tools to measure performance and give you recommendations. What you need to improve?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think it&#8217;s very valuable to learn from those and internalize that knowledge that you get from running your site through one of, through some of these tools. And then from there you can think about how can I actually address this problem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:44] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Well, Felix, sadly, we&#8217;re out of time.

These included the possibility of changing the popular themes algorithm to more prominently feature block themes, and/or adding a new &#8220;Block&#8221; menu item next to Popular and Latest on the themes directory home page.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The directory is going through some growing pains as themes that are compatible with the site editor are the only ones that offer access to everything WordPress has to offer in the new paradigm of blocks. Yet, the 94 available block themes represent fewer than 1% of the directory&#8217;s 9,761 themes. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s an interesting time in WordPress&#8217; history where the theme a user selects can significantly limit the ability to take advantage of WordPress&#8217; latest features. This is why some contributors are proposing that block themes get more visibility in the directory. It directly impacts FSE adoption and consequently its improvement, as people using it is the pathway to better quality feedback that will shape its future in WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After five weeks the ticket went silent, following WordPress lead developer Dion Hulse&#8217;s recommendation that re-doing the front page of the directory would likely be the best way to solve the needs communicated in the ticket. Two weeks ago the discussion was reignited  when WordPress theme developer and Themes Team contributor Dumitru Brinzan <a href=\"https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/6330#comment:19\">commented</a> with strong opposition to the idea of promoting block themes: </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><strong>This goes against everything</strong> that was discussed about the role of themes in the past 10 years at least.</p><p>In the past there have been a lot of instances when a new tab with themes, a different algorithm, a different order, different X, Y, Z have been appropriate.</p><p>Every single time theme authors heard the same song: it is not the role of .org to promote or market any particular product. It is not the role of .org to make the themes repo look like the plugins repo.</p><p>The logical request of removing the default Twenty themes from the Popular tab fell on deaf years.</p><p>But now there&#8217;s a new shiny toy (that is not even ready or wanted by the general public).<br />And suddenly people with a direct interest in having a spotlight on their themes are pushing this &#8220;new&#8221; idea.</p><p>This is a spit in the face of the hundreds (if not thousands) of theme authors that have been contributing to .org until now.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Automattic-sponsored Themes Team contributor Sarah Norris <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/wordpress.org/pull/85\">submitted a PR</a> that adds a &#8216;Block&#8217; tab to the Theme Directory filter list. It filters themes using the full-site-editing tag, which is currently buried three clicks deep for those who know how to apply the filter. </p>\n\n\n\n<img />source: <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/wordpress.org/pull/85\">PR to Add Block tab to filter list</a>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;These types of themes are more commonly referred to as block themes, so by adding this tag, we are reducing the confusion between these terms and making it clearer how to filter by block themes in the directory,&#8221; Norris said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hulse concluded that the PR was &#8220;the most straight forward way forward here, making the most impact today,&#8221; but questioned whether &#8220;block&#8221; is the best term to use. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Christian Zumbrunnen, another participant in the discussion, suggested classic themes get a label as well, such as &#8220;Classic,&#8221; which could be changed to &#8220;Deprecated&#8221; sometime in the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;And another question: why would my non-FSE themes built for the Block Editor be relegated to the &#8216;classic themes&#8217; category?&#8221; Brinzan said. &#8220;Why give priority specifically to FSE themes, all the while calling them &#8216;block&#8217; themes? My classic themes work perfectly well with blocks. Why create any more confusion under the false pretense of making things &#8216;easier and clearer?\'&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The difference here is that while most themes now support the block editor for content, very few include full support for the block-based site editor. Brinzan contends that contributors should work towards creating a more efficient search and improving the browsing/filtering experience for themes:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>The whole directory needs to be improved. It&#8217;s not right (or fair) to prioritize one type of themes, when many of them aren&#8217;t even production-ready.<br />Funneling all WordPress users towards an unfinished and clunky product won&#8217;t do anyone any good. WordPress is not known for its elegant UI, and this will make things worse. WordPress users are not guinea pigs to force Gutenberg and FSE on them at every step. Let this process take its natural course.<br /></p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress theme developers are facing the inevitable task of updating their themes to be FSE-enabled in order to remain relevant in the new era of using blocks to edit all aspects of a WordPress site. Themes that don&#8217;t support the full range of the platform&#8217;s features do not have long before they become the last vestiges of a bygone era of WordPress themes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hendrik Luehrsen, who agreed that full-site editing themes should be easier to find, said he is concerned about how to do that without &#8220;without downgrading the rest of the themes or without creating an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osborne_effect\">Osborne Effect</a>.&#8221; This notion, which is based on the downfall of the Osborne Computer Corporation, particularly affects consumer electronic products where prematurely announcing the imminent release of a technologically superior product can damage the sales of existing products.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Osborne Effect may not be applicable in this case, since WordPress has already shipped FSE to those who want to take advantage of it, and block themes, the successor of legacy WordPress themes, are already here. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Automattic-sponsored Themes Team contributor Jeffrey Pearce <a href=\"https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/6330#comment:59\">urged contributors to reach a consensus</a> and reminded them that the solution can always be iterated on later.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s important to highlight that block themes can only get better with improved exposure by usage, which seems to be what most folks in here agree on,&#8221; Pearce said. &#8220;The solutions in this ticket don&#8217;t seek to demote classic themes, but rather they seek to improve the discoverability of Block Themes instead of the current filter approach.&#8221;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 13 Jul 2022 05:27:34 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:13;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:144:\"HeroPress: Finding a second chance in life through WordPress – വേർഡ്പ്രസ്സിലൂടെ ജീവിതവിജയം\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:56:\"https://heropress.com/?post_type=heropress-essays&p=4542\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:172:\"https://heropress.com/essays/finding-a-second-chance-in-life-through-wordpress/#utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=finding-a-second-chance-in-life-through-wordpress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:83250:\"<img width=\"1024\" height=\"512\" src=\"https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/071122-min.jpg\" class=\"attachment-large size-large wp-post-image\" alt=\"Pull Quote: If I have achieved anything in life today, it is thanks to WordPress and its community.\" />\n<p><a href=\"https://heropress.com/feed/#malayalam\">ഈ ഉപന്യാസം മലയാളത്തിലും ലഭ്യമാണ്</a></p>\n\n\n\nHere is Hari reading his own story aloud.\n\n\n\n<p>I will never forget the day I turned 22. I was officially at the lowest point in life as I woke up that morning. While my peers were employed with multinational companies or pursuing higher education at top universities worldwide, I had just been fired from my first “job” and was broke. Things were so bad that I had even become a pariah in my own family. Setting aside all those negative thoughts, I pulled myself out of my bed and switched on my computer, which lit up with a partly-written blog post on the TinyMCE editor of WordPress 3.0.1. That sight filled me with hope. I felt a strong creative urge to continue writing and started typing away. After completing that post, I leaned on my chair, marveling at my creation. All my negative emotions had now disappeared. I realized that even if I failed in life, I would always have two things with me &#8211; my blog and the open source software that powered it (WordPress). And that was all I needed to trudge onward.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Little did I know that this open source software (that powers 40%+ of all websites in the world today) would eventually become my <em>raison d&#8217;être</em> and give me a life I could never even dream of!&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-discovering-wordpress\">Discovering WordPress&nbsp;</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I was born and brought up in Thiruvananthapuram, in Kerala, India as an only child to engineer parents. Since computers and programming had always fascinated me as a kid, I enrolled in an engineering course with a specialization in information technology after high school. My goal was to take up a career in technology. I even had lofty dreams of pursuing research in computer science. My batch had a four-month break before college started, and during this time, I started working with my friends’ web services startup. One evening, while working on a client’s website, I was introduced to WordPress. It was a revelation. You could create and customize websites from an admin panel without needing to hand-code in HTML! I loved it and wanted to create a WordPress website on my own. However, since I did not have the resources to purchase a domain and hosting package, I did the next best thing &#8211; I set up a blog on WordPress.com.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the cliche goes, that was the beginning of a beautiful friendship. :)&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-thriving-with-wordpress-during-tough-times\">Thriving with WordPress during tough times</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Soon, the holidays were over, and college started. With high hopes, I stepped foot into one of Kerala’s top engineering colleges. However, within a few days, I realized that I was a misfit in this system.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Indian educational system is designed for rote-learning by default and rejects everyone that does not comply. My ‘radical’ dreams of thinking out of the box, finding knowledge outside prescribed textbooks, exploring the practical side of concepts, and even furthering original ideas &#8211; made me an outcast. I was disappointed, disillusioned, and eventually lost interest in academics. To add insult to the injury, my friends kicked me out of the web services startup, which was my saving grace during this ordeal. During this challenging time, it was WordPress that kept me going.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pouring my mind into my WordPress blog helped me survive the trauma of college. Fueled by curiosity, I tried to find practical applications of core computer science concepts taught in college by tinkering with WordPress code and creating mock websites. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote><p>Slowly I started earning pocket money through freelance projects and Google AdSense. </p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>I eventually bought my own domain and moved to self-hosted WordPress. All-in-all, WordPress not only helped me survive college but taught me more than college ever could. By the end of four years, I had learned PHP, MySQL, web designing and development, open source philosophy, and even became a better writer thanks to WordPress! Even as the nightmare called college went on by the side, I collected a bunch of professional accolades. The most memorable ones include <a href=\"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/pipermail/india/2009-March/001497.html\">being an honorary speaker at one of India’s top engineering colleges</a>, getting a chance to <a href=\"https://harishanker.net/2009/06/richard-stallman-interview/\">interview Richard Stallman</a> himself, <a href=\"http://www.mindful.org/student-wins-mindful-leadership-award/\">winning an international essay competition</a>, and becoming a <a href=\"https://www.thehindu.com/profile/author/Hari-Shanker-R-/\">freelance journalist with one of India’s national newspapers</a>. Life was challenging but promising!</p>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/1_Presenting_at-NITC-scaled.jpg\"><img /></a><em>Presenting at NIT Calicut &#8211; one of India’s top engineering colleges, as an invited speaker</em>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/2_Mindful_Leadership.jpg\"><img /></a><em>Selected as a runner-up for Mindful Leadership co-organized by University of Dayton, Ohio and Loyola Institute of Business Administration</em>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-finding-out-about-automattic\">Finding out about Automattic</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>My love for WordPress encouraged me to add a question about <a href=\"https://ma.tt/\">Matt Mullenweg</a>, the co-founder of WordPress, in a trivia quiz that I hosted at an intercollegiate quiz in my third year. The question went unanswered, but while preparing for the quiz, I <a href=\"https://usatoday30.usatoday.com/tech/news/2009-01-27-wordpress-creator-blog_N.htm\">learned</a> about Matt’s company &#8211; <a href=\"https://automattic.com/\">Automattic, Inc</a>. Automattic owned WordPress.com and had 30+ employees working remotely from all corners of the world then. Since WordPress was <em>everything </em>to me, working for the company that runs WordPress.com felt like a dream. I believed that I had a real shot at making it to Automattic; since it was a fully distributed company, I could work remotely from India without having to worry about work permits or visas. The “<a href=\"https://automattic.com/work-with-us/job/happiness-engineer/\">Happiness Engineer</a>” role seemed like a perfect fit for me, and I decided to apply right after graduating from college a year later.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/IwEYKJ0aWaB0VfHnBxrpnLwaKjJmsirO438qSNescoNrcfLMMsHGUH1mH1rzmQ5tNhhCem0dmRCGEDsM0D11HKW6CWKSsAT8pGEvGaq43wEQQJBxUKAxforW8D-WQASsKx7HxvivecECzg1ybyU\" alt=\"\" /><em>A glimpse from the same quiz that I hosted where I would shortly ask that question about Matt that would go unanswered!</em>\n\n\n\n<p>However, life would have other plans for me.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-dreams-come-crashing-down-but-not-without-hope\">Dreams come crashing down &#8211; but not without hope!</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>History teaches us that every misfit meets debilitating failure early on in life. After surviving for nearly three and a half years, my crash came in my final year. Since I lacked the minimum attendance, I did not graduate with my batchmates and was asked to repeat my last semester with my juniors. It was a major blow &#8211; not just for my ego, but also for my existence. Nevertheless, I did not lose hope. I decided to stay engaged during the six-month gap before my final semester classes restarted and signed up as a journalist with a local web portal. However, before I would complete two full months in this “job”, I got fired. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote><p>That was the last nail in my coffin. I lost every ounce of hope. I started hearing voices in my head accusing me of being a failure. </p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>I was officially branded as a loser as <em>everyone</em> started ridiculing me for my plight, left, right, and center. A psychiatrist, who happens to be a family friend, diagnosed me with clinical depression and prescribed medicines with extreme side effects that made me feel worse.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Only one ‘person’ stood by me through thick and thin with unwavering faith &#8211; and that was WordPress.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It slowly dawned upon me that even if I failed everywhere else, I knew WordPress inside out. I had the confidence to do anything and everything with it; thus giving me a real shot at a proper career. I started freelancing full-time. I was not earning a ton of money, but freelancing helped me pay my bills. I started gaining confidence as I got more and more good reviews for my work. No one knew about my “job” and I did not bother to change that perception as well. My parents would sneer at me for wasting my time spending hours in front of the computer instead of studying or applying for jobs when I was <em>actually</em> working and earning <em>real </em>money! College was soon done and dusted. I consulted a more qualified mental health professional who confirmed my original suspicion that I was misdiagnosed by the psychiatrist and took me out of medicines. I slowly started getting back on track.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Shortly after that, WordPress led me to my first ‘real’ job as a Project Manager with a multinational startup based in Kochi. My primary responsibility at this company was to oversee a network of WordPress websites, and it was a job I thoroughly enjoyed. Being honored and respected for my skills and abilities proved to be a game-changer for me. Over time, I also saw my life improve slowly and steadily. I soon found myself working as a banker in a public sector bank in India. During this time, I met the love of my life, and we got married and started living on our terms. Since I was working in the bank, I was not using WordPress for work anymore. However, my Twitter bio still had a “WordPress guru” moniker. I would keep tinkering with WordPress in my free time, as working with WordPress always brought me joy. The bank job was not making me happy, and I started thinking of the next step in my career.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-automattic-beckons\">Automattic beckons</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It was at this stage that my mind naturally went back to Automattic. After I discovered the company in my third year, I would visit their <a href=\"https://automattic.com/work-with-us/\">jobs page</a> at least a hundred times in the next six years. I came close to applying several times but always stopped in my tracks due to raging self-doubt. I was still quite the <em>persona non grata</em> in both my immediate and extended family and was being mocked everywhere. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote><p>The only person who believed in me was my wife &#8211; <a href=\"https://archanamohan.com/\">Archana</a>. </p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>One day, I confessed my desire to work at Automattic to her. She held my hand, looked firmly into my eyes, and spoke with conviction: <em>“You are going to make it to Automattic; I will bet my life on it.” </em>To this day, Archana continues to be my pillar of support and my biggest fan &#8211; the rest of what you are going to read would simply not have happened, had it not been for Archana’s iron-willed faith in me.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/4_First_ever_WP_Swag.jpeg\"><img /></a><em>Sporting my first ever WordPress swag!</em>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/5_Archana_Hari_Berlin.jpeg\"><img /></a><em>With Archana, my wife!</em>\n\n\n\n\n<p>I decided to take Automattic seriously and started preparing. Since I had lost touch with WordPress, I started tinkering with WordPress more and built lots of WP websites. I also used my free time to work in the WordPress.org and WordPress.com forums. Interestingly, working at the bank helped me gain support skills that I lacked previously for the role that I aimed to apply for (Happiness Engineer), so I started feeling more and more confident about applying. Even after nine years as a WordPress user, I had never really explored its community, and I had the pleasure of discovering it on social media at that point. I was fascinated by a Twitter account, curiously named “<a href=\"https://twitter.com/heropress/\">HeroPress</a>” &#8211; which followed me back as soon as I followed it. I visited <a href=\"https://heropress.com\">https://heropress.com</a> that evening and went down a rabbit hole of inspirational WordPress stories. I read about several people who found success due to my favorite open source software, including many folks from my corner of the world. HeroPress was the inspiration I finally needed and was a key milestone in my WordPress journey.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was now all set to apply, and I couldn’t help but wonder &#8211; would I get the chance to write about my journey on this very website, someday?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-a-dream-come-true\">A dream come true</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>After three months of dedicated preparation, I finally bit the bullet and applied for the Happiness Engineer role at Automattic, in November 2015. I heard back from the Automattic hiring team within three weeks and went on to complete a series of interviews and tasks, which was followed by a paid trial. In February 2016, three months after I got my first email from the Automattic hiring team, Matt Mullenweg (yes, the same person who I created a quiz question on, seven years back) gave me an offer to work at Automattic as a full-time Happiness Engineer after a two-hour text-chat interview over Slack.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I had just watched <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0454921/\">The Pursuit of Happyness</a> (again) a few days back and the<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56fngopihOo\"> final scene from the movie</a> came to my mind, that very moment Matt gave me the offer…</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<a href=\"https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/6_was-it-as-easy.jpeg\"><img /></a></div>\n\n\n<p>The next few moments were a blur. I was on top of the world! I clearly remember hugging my wife tight &#8211; we both could not control our tears and wept with joy for several minutes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote><p>There were situations in the past when I was so frustrated that I thought of calling it quits, unable to bear the pain and suffering. </p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Not too long ago, I used to be derided by my peers and my own family for my academics and my failures on a daily basis. Some people did not even bother to mince words &#8211; I was branded as a <em>“good-for-nothing idiot who brings nothing but shame to our family”</em>. My own parents had even asked me several times to <em>“drop out of college and consider blue-collar jobs and unskilled labor because that is the only thing you are worthy of!”</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here I was, the black sheep of my family, beaming with a signed offer letter for my dream job at my dream company! All thanks to an open source software built by contributors all over the world that stood by me through thick and thin.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-the-story-continues\">The story continues</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The rest of my life, the past six years, feels like a dream even today. I still pinch myself sometimes to see if this is indeed real. Today, I have evolved into a better human being, a capable professional, and a leader. The very first week of joining Automattic in April 2016, I flew to Austin, TX to attend a team meetup with my colleagues &#8211; there was a time in my life when I could barely imagine boarding a domestic flight, let alone flying to the United States! I have lost count of the number of times I have traveled around the world in the past six years &#8211; I have friends in every nook and corner of the world and have had the privilege of having some of the best experiences in life, thanks to my travels.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/7_In_Austin_With_Teammates-scaled.jpeg\"><img /></a><em>Stopping traffic at South Congress near Austin Downtown with my teammates at Automattic!&nbsp;</em>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/8_Hari_Lisbon-scaled.jpeg\"><img /></a><em>A picture with my teammates at Automattic in Lisbon Portugal, at a team meetup</em>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/9_A8cGM_Whistler.jpg\"><img /></a><em>At a photobooth with my teammates at the Automattic Grand Meetup in Whistler, Canada in 2017</em>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/10_Bubble_Football.png\"><img /></a><em>After a fun game of Bubble Football with my team in Barcelona, Spain</em>\n\n\n\n<p>My love for WordPress got me involved with the global WordPress community. I started by organizing local meetups in the city of Kochi (where we moved after I joined Automattic) and went on to organize three WordCamps and scores of meetup events. I also started translating WordPress to Malayalam (my native language) in my free time. I also got involved in the WordPress Community in India and made many great friends &#8211; <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/adityakane\">Aditya</a>, <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/ajay-aravind/\">Ajay</a>, <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/ajithrn/\">Ajith</a>, <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/gounder/\">Alex</a>, <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/aravindajith/\">Aravind</a>,  <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/mbigul/\">Bigul</a>, <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/hardeepasrani/\">Hardeep</a>, <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/wpcustomizer/\">Hitha</a>, <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/kcjagadeep/\">Jagadeep</a>, <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/josevarghese/\">Jose</a>, <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/nejwrks/\">Nebu</a>, <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/nitkr/\">Nithin</a>, <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/rohittm/\">Rohit</a>, <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/sheebaabraham/\">Sheeba</a>, <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/yoga1103/\">Yogesh</a>… the list is too long for this essay, believe me!

In April 2020, I went through an internal hiring process and switched roles to become a Community Wrangler, working full-time on the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/\">Make/WordPress Community Team</a>, as one of <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/five-for-the-future/pledge/automattic/\">Automattic’s Five for the Future contributors</a>. Over the past two years, I realized that working with the community is my true calling. Supporting our events program, even while navigating the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic made me realize how much our community loves WordPress. It has equally been a privilege and a humbling experience.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From January through March 2022, I was selected to lead my team in Automattic, where I helped onboard four new team members that we hired. Leading our team for three months continues to be the best professional experience I have had so far. Earlier in 2022, I was <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/2022/01/03/announcement-team-representatives-for-2022/\">selected as the Team Representative for the Make/WordPress Community team</a>, and we just supported a vibrant team of local and global community organizers to host one of the biggest WordPress events in the world &#8211; <a href=\"https://europe.wordcamp.org/2022/\">WordCamp Europe 2022</a>. As I am writing this essay, I am enjoying my sabbatical at Automattic (all Automatticians that have completed five years working for Automattic are eligible for a paid, three-month sabbatical).&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/16_My_Current_a8c_team-scaled.jpeg\"><img /></a><em>With my current team at Barcelona, Spain, in April 2022</em>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<a href=\"https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/17_WCEU2022_Community_Team_table.jpeg\"><img /></a><em>Introducing the Community Team on stage at WordCamp Europe 2022</em></div>\n\n\n<p>It has been 16 years since I first started using WordPress. In other words, WordPress has been a part of my life for nearly half of it. My mind still goes back to that morning on my 22nd birthday. Even though I had lost all hope, I clung to WordPress with both my arms. I had never even imagined that it would give me a life that I could barely dream of. But even in my darkest days, this open source software and its community gave me hope and pushed me forward.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If I have achieved anything in life today, it is thanks to WordPress and its community.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I will <em>forever</em> be grateful.</p>\n\n\n\n<h1 id=\"malayalam\">വേർഡ്പ്രസ്സിലൂടെ ജീവിതവിജയം</h1>\n\n\n\nഹരി തന്റെ കഥ ഉറക്കെ വായിക്കുന്നത് നിങ്ങൾക്ക് കേൾക്കാം.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n<p>എനിക്ക് 22 വയസ്സ് തികഞ്ഞ ആ ദിവസം ഒരിക്കലും മറക്കാനാകില്ല. കാരണം, ജീവിതത്തിലെ ഏറ്റവും മോശം ഘട്ടത്തിൽ ആയിരുന്നു അന്ന് ഞാൻ. രാവിലെ ഉറക്കമുണർന്നപ്പോൾ മനസ്സാകെ കലുഷിതമായിരുന്നു. കൂടെ പഠിച്ചവരൊക്കെ വലിയ മൾട്ടിനാഷണൽ കമ്പനികളിൽ ജോലിക്കോ ഉപരിപഠനത്തിനായി വിദേശ സർവ്വകലാശാലകളിലേക്കോ പോയി തുടങ്ങിയപ്പോൾ ഞാനാകട്ടെ ആദ്യ ജോലിയിൽ നിന്നും പിരിച്ചു വിടപ്പെട്ട്, കൈയിൽ പത്ത് പൈസ ഇല്ലാത്ത ദുരവസ്ഥയിലായിരുന്നു. ചുരുക്കി പറഞ്ഞാൽ, വീട്ടുകാർക്കും നാട്ടുകാർക്കും വേണ്ടാത്ത, വെറുക്കപ്പെട്ട ഒരു ജന്മം! വിഷമങ്ങളൊക്കെ ഉള്ളിലൊതുക്കി വച്ച്, ഒരു വിധം ഞാൻ നേരെ കംപ്യൂട്ടറിന്റെ മുന്നിൽ നിലയുറപ്പിച്ചു. സ്‌ക്രീനിൽ അതാ WordPress 3.0.1 ഇന്റെ TinyMCE എഡിറ്ററും, അതിൽ ആംഗലേയത്തിൽ പാതിയെഴുതിയ ഒരു ബ്ലോഗ് പോസ്റ്റും, പതിയെ തെളിഞ്ഞു വന്നു. ആ കാഴ്ച കണ്ടപ്പോൾ മനസ്സിൽ പ്രതീക്ഷയുടെ ഒരു കണിക വന്നത് പോലെ. എവിടുന്നോ ഏതോ ശക്തി ഞരമ്പുകളിൽ ഞാൻ പോലുമറിയാതെ വന്നു കയറിയ പ്രതീതി. ആ ശക്തി മുറുകെപിടിച്ച്‌ ഞാൻ വേഗത്തിൽ ടൈപ്പ് ചെയ്തു തുടങ്ങി. താമസിയാതെ ആ പോസ്റ്റ് ഞാൻ എഴുതി പൂർത്തിയാക്കി. കസേരയിൽ ചാഞ്ഞിരുന്ന്, എന്റെ സ്വന്തം കലാസൃഷ്ടി ആസ്വദിച്ച്, അൽപ്പനേരം ഞാൻ അവിടെ അങ്ങ് ഇരുന്നു പോയി. മനസ്സിലെ വിഷമങ്ങളൊക്കെ എങ്ങോ മാഞ്ഞ് പോയത് പോലെ…</p>\n\n\n\n<p>ആ പ്രഭാതത്തിൽ എനിക്കൊരു വെളിപാടുണ്ടായി. ജീവിതത്തിൽ എവിടെ ഞാൻ പരാജയപ്പെട്ടാലും എന്റെ കൂടെ രണ്ടു കാര്യങ്ങൾ എപ്പോഴും ഉണ്ടാകും: എന്റെ ബ്ലോഗും, അതിന്റെ പിന്നിലെ സ്വതന്ത്ര സോഫ്റ്റ്‌വെയറായ വേർഡ്പ്രെസും. വർഷങ്ങൾക്കിപ്പുറം, ഇന്ന് ഇന്റർനെറ്റിലെ 40 ശതമാനം വെബസൈറ്റുകൾ പ്രവർത്തിപ്പിക്കുന്ന ഇതേ സോഫ്റ്റ്‌വെയർ എന്റെ ജീവിതം മാറ്റി മറിക്കുമെന്ന് അന്ന് ഞാൻ സ്വപ്നത്തിൽ പോലും ചിന്തിരിച്ചുന്നില്ല.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>ഹൗഡി, വേർഡ്പ്രസ്സ്!</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>കേരളതലസ്ഥാനമായ തിരുവനന്തപുരത്ത്, സർക്കാർ സർവീസിൽ ഉയർന്ന തസ്തികകളിൽ ജോലി ചെയ്യുന്ന രണ്ടു എൻജിനിയർമാരുടെ ഒറ്റ മകനായി ആണ് നമ്മുടെ ജനനം. ഓർമ വച്ച നാൾ മുതൽ തന്നെ കംപ്യൂട്ടറുകളിലും പ്രോഗ്രാമിങ്ങിലും ആയിരുന്നു കമ്പം. അതിനാൽ സ്‌കൂൾ ജീവിതം പൂർത്തിയാക്കിയ ശേഷം, തിരുവനന്തപുരത്തെ മികച്ച ഒരു എൻജിനിയറിങ് കോളേജിൽ ഇൻഫർമേഷൻ ടെക്നോളജി എഞ്ചിനിയിറങ്ങിനു ഞാൻ ചേർന്നു. അന്നേ ആഗ്രഹങ്ങൾക്കും സ്വപ്നങ്ങൾക്കും പഞ്ഞമൊന്നുമില്ലായിരുന്നു &#8211; ട്ടെക്ക് മേഖലയിൽ ജോലി ചെയ്യണമെന്നും കംപ്യൂട്ടർ സയൻസിൽ ഗവേഷണം ചെയ്യണമെന്നുമൊക്കെ ആയിരുന്നു മോഹം. കോളേജ് തുടങ്ങുന്നതിനു മുന്നേയുള്ള നാല് മാസത്തെ അവധിക്കാലത്ത് സമയം കൊല്ലാനായി കൂട്ടുകാർ നടത്തിയിരുന്നു ഒരു വെബ് സ്റ്റാർട്ടപ്പിൽ ഞാനും ചേർന്നു. ഒരു ദിവസം, ഒരു ക്ലയന്റിന്റെ വെബ്‌സൈറ്റ് നിർമ്മിക്കുമ്പോഴാണ് ഞാൻ വേർഡ്പ്രസ്സിനെ പരിചയപ്പെടുന്നത്. HTML ഉം CSS ഉം മാത്രം ഉപയോഗിച്ച് വെബ്‌സൈറ്റ് നിർമിക്കാൻ അറിയുമായിരുന്ന എനിക്ക് അത് ഒരു അദ്‌ഭുതമായിരുന്നു. <em>“ഇപ്പോൾ കോഡ് എഴുതാതെ തന്നെ ഒരു മികച്ച ഡാഷ്‌ബോർഡ് ഉപയോഗിച്ച് മാത്രം നമുക്ക് ഒരു സൈറ്റ് ഉണ്ടാക്കാം! കൊള്ളാല്ലോ വീഡിയോൺ!”</em> അന്ന് തന്നെ സ്വന്തമായി വേർഡ്പ്രസ്സ് ഉപയോഗിച്ച് സൈറ്റ് നിർമിക്കിക്കാനായുള്ള പണി ഞാൻ തുടങ്ങി. എന്നാൽ ഡൊമെയ്‌നും ഹോസ്റ്റിംഗും വാങ്ങാൻ നമ്മുടെ കയ്യിൽ എവിടെ കാശ്? അതിനാൽ wordpress.com ഇൽ ഒരു ബ്ലോഗ് തുടങ്ങി തത്കാലം തൃപ്തിപ്പെട്ടു.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>വർഷങ്ങൾ നീണ്ടു നിൽക്കുന്ന ഒരു സൗഹൃദത്തിന്റെ തുടക്കമായിരുന്നു അത്. :)&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>പ്രതിസന്ധികളിൽ വേർഡ്പ്രസ്സ് സഹായത്തിനെത്തുന്നു</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>അങ്ങനെ ഒടുവിൽ അവധി കഴിഞ്ഞു കോളേജ് തുടങ്ങി. എന്നാൽ വലിയ പ്രതീക്ഷയോടെ കോളേജിലേക്ക് കാലെടുത്തു വച്ച എന്നെ കാത്തിരുന്നത് തീർത്താൽ തീരാത്ത പ്രതിസന്ധികളാണ്.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>ഇന്നത്തെ ഭാരതീയ ഉപരിപഠന സമ്പ്രദായത്തിൽ പരീക്ഷകൾ മാത്രം മുന്നിൽ കണ്ട് കാണാതെ പഠിക്കുന്ന വ്യക്തികൾക്ക് മികച്ച വിജയം നേടാനാകും. എന്നാൽ പുസ്തകത്തിനപ്പുറത്തെ അറിവുകൾ കാംക്ഷിക്കുന്ന, പഠനവിഷങ്ങളുടെ പ്രായോഗിക തലങ്ങൾ തിരയുന്ന, തീർത്താൽ തീരാത്ത സംശയങ്ങളുള്ള, പുത്തൻ ആശയങ്ങൾ നിരന്തരം മെനെഞ്ഞെടുക്കുന്ന, എന്നെ പോലൊരു വ്യക്തിക്ക് പറ്റിയ ഒരു വ്യവസ്ഥിതി ആയിരുന്നില്ല അത്. കുറച്ചധികം തിക്താനുഭവങ്ങൾ വേണ്ടി വന്നു, എനിക്ക് ആ സത്യം മനസ്സിലാകാൻ. ഏറെ നാളത്തെ വിഷമങ്ങൾക്കും, സങ്കടങ്ങൾക്കുമൊടുവിൽ പഠനത്തോടുള്ള എന്റെ താത്പര്യം പാടെ നശിച്ചു എന്ന് തന്നെ പറയാം. കൂനുംമേൽ കുരു എന്നെ പോലെ എന്റെ സുഹൃത്തുക്കൾ അവരുടെ സ്റ്റാർട്ടപ്പിൽ നിന്നും എന്നെ പിരിച്ചു വിട്ടു. ഈ ക്ലേശകരമായ സമയം മുഴുവൻ വേർഡ്പ്രസ്സ് ആയിരുന്നു എനിക്ക് ആകെ ഉണ്ടായിരുന്ന തുണ.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>കോളേജിലെ വിഷമങ്ങൾ ഞാൻ മറന്നത് മനസ്സിലെ വേദനകൾ ബ്ലോഗിൽ സ്ഥിരമായി കുറിച്ചിട്ടുകൊണ്ടാണ്. പഠനത്തിൽ താത്പര്യം നശിച്ചിട്ടും, എന്നിലെ കെട്ടടങ്ങാത്ത ജിജ്ഞാസ, വേർഡ്പ്രെസ്സിൽ കോഡ് ചെയ്തും വെബ്‌സൈറ്റുകൾ നിർമിച്ചും പാഠ്യവിഷയങ്ങളുടെ പ്രായോഗിക തലങ്ങൾ കണ്ടെത്താൻ സഹായിച്ചു. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote><p></p><p>ചെറിയ വെബ് കരാർ ജോലികളുലൂടെയും, ഗൂഗിളിന്റെ ആഡ്‌സെൻസ് (Google AdSense) പ്രോഗ്രാം വഴി വന്ന ബ്ലോഗിലെ പരസ്യങ്ങളിലൂടെയും, ചെറിയ ഒരു വരുമാനം ഞാൻ നേടിത്തുടങ്ങി.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>വൈകാതെ സ്വന്തം ഡൊമെയ്‌നും ഹോസ്റ്റിംഗും വാങ്ങിച്ച ശേഷം self-hosted വേർഡ്പ്രെസ്സിലേക്ക് ഞാൻ എന്റെ ബ്ലോഗ് മാറ്റി. ചുരുക്കി പറഞ്ഞാൽ കോളേജിൽ നിന്നും പഠിച്ചതിനേക്കാൾ വിഷയങ്ങൾ വേർഡ്പ്രസ്സ് എന്നെ പഠിപ്പിച്ചു. നാല് വർഷം കൊണ്ട് PHP, MySQL, വെബ് ഡെവെലപ്‌മെന്റ്, ഓപ്പൺ സോഴ്സ് തത്ത്വങ്ങൾ, മുതൽ പ്രഫഷണൽ എഴുത്ത് (ആംഗലേയത്തിൽ) വരെ വേർഡ്പ്രസ്സ് കാരണം ഞാൻ പഠിച്ചു. അതെ സമയം പല സമ്മാനങ്ങളും അംഗീകാരങ്ങളും എന്നെത്തേടി വന്നു തുടങ്ങി. ഇന്ത്യയിലെതന്നെ മികച്ച എഞ്ചിനിയറിങ്ങ് കോളേജുകളിൽ ഒന്നിൽ ക്ഷണിക്കപ്പെട്ട പ്രാസംഗികനാകാനും, സ്വതന്ത്ര സോഫ്റ്റ്വെയർ ഉപജ്ഞാതാക്കളിൽ പ്രമുഖനായ റിച്ചാർഡ് സ്റ്റാൾമാനെ നേരിട്ട് അഭിമുഖം ചെയ്യാനും, പ്രസിദ്ധമായ ഒരു ലോകോത്തര ഉപന്യാസ മത്സരത്തിൽ വിജയിക്കാനും, ഇന്ത്യയുടെ ഏറ്റവും മികച്ച ആംഗലേയ പത്രങ്ങളിൽ ഒന്നായ ‘ദി ഹിന്ദു’ ഇൽ ലേഖകനാകാനും എനിക്ക് സാധിച്ചു. അങ്ങനെ കഠിനമായ പ്രശ്നങ്ങളിലും വേദനകളിലും സന്തോഷം കണ്ടെത്തി വേർഡ്പ്രെസ്സ് കനിഞ്ഞനുഗ്രഹിച്ചു തന്ന ശക്തിയോടെ ഞാൻ മുന്നോട്ട് നടന്നു. <span></span></p>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/1_Presenting_at-NITC-scaled.jpg\"><img /></a>നാഷണൽ ഇൻസ്റ്റിറ്റ്യൂട്ട് ഓഫ് ടെക്നോളജി കോഴിക്കോട് വച്ച് ബ്ലോഗ്ഗിങ്ങിനെ കുറിച്ച് ഞാൻ ഒരു പ്രസന്റേഷൻ നടത്തിയപ്പോൾ&nbsp;\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/2_Mindful_Leadership.jpg\"><img /></a>University of Dayton, Ohio ഉം&nbsp;

നമ്മുടെ പഴയ സുഹൃത്തായ വേർഡ്പ്രസ്സ്!&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>തീയിൽ കുരുത്താൽ വെയിലത്തു വാടില്ല എന്നാണല്ലോ പഴമൊഴി. അങ്ങനെ തീയിൽ കത്തി നശിച്ചു വെയിലത്തു ഒരു കരികട്ട പോലെ കിടന്നുരുകുമ്പോളാണ് എനിക്ക് ഒരു സത്യം മനസ്സിലായത്. ജീവിതത്തിൽ എന്തൊക്കെ നഷ്ടപ്പെട്ടാലും എനിക്കുള്ള വേർഡ്പ്രസ്സ് പരിജ്ഞാനം ഒരിക്കലും നഷ്ടപ്പെടില്ല. വേർഡ്പ്രെസ്സിൽ ഞാനൊരു പുലി തന്നെ ആയിരുന്നു എന്ന് മാത്രമല്ല വേർഡ്പ്രെസ്സിൽ എന്ത് വേണമെങ്കിലും ചെയ്യാം എന്ന ആത്മവിശ്വാസവും എനിക്കുണ്ടായിരുന്നു. അങ്ങനെ പൂജ്യത്തിൽ നിന്നും ഞാൻ പതുക്കെ കര കയറി തുടങ്ങി. ഇടയ്ക്കൊക്കെ ചെയ്തിരുന്ന കരാറടിസ്ഥാനത്തിലുള്ള ജോലികൾ (freelancing) സ്ഥിരമായി ചെയ്തായിരുന്നു എന്റെ തുടക്കം. വരുമാനമൊക്കെ കണക്കായിരുന്നു, പക്ഷെ എന്റെ ആവശ്യങ്ങൾക്കുള്ള പണം കിട്ടുന്നുണ്ടായിരുന്നു. ഓരോ ജോലി തീർത്തു കൊടുക്കുമ്പോഴും ക്ലയന്റ്സിന്റെ നല്ല വാക്കുകൾ കേൾക്കുമ്പോഴും ആത്മവിശ്വാസം വർധിക്കുന്നത് ഞാനറിഞ്ഞു. വീട്ടുകാർക്ക് അപ്പോഴും എന്നോട് നല്ല പുച്ഛമായിരുന്നു &#8211; ഞാൻ ജോലി ചെയ്യുമ്പോൾ പോയി പഠിക്കാനോ ജോലിക്ക് അപേക്ഷിക്കാനോ ഒക്കെ പറഞ്ഞു അവർ എന്നെ വഴക്കു പറയുമായിരുന്നു. ഞാൻ അതൊന്നും കാര്യമാക്കാതെ ജോലിയിൽ മുഴുകി. വൈകാതെ കോളേജ് എന്ന പെരുമൺ ദുരന്തം അവസാനിച്ചു. ഇതിനിടെ, വീട്ടുകാരറിയാതെ,&nbsp; അറിയപ്പെടുന്ന മറ്റൊരു സൈക്കോളജിസ്റ്റിനെ ഞാൻ കണ്ടു. വിദഗ്‌ധ പരിശോധനയ്ക്ക് ശേഷം എനിക്ക് മാനസിക ബുദ്ധിമുട്ട് ഒന്നും തന്നെ ഇല്ല എന്ന് അദ്ദേഹം വിധിയെഴുതുകയും, മരുന്നുകൾ നിർത്തുകയും ചെയ്തു. പതുക്കെ ഞാൻ ജീവിതത്തിലേക്ക് വീണ്ടും പിച്ച വച്ച് തുടങ്ങി.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>പിന്നീടങ്ങോട്ട് എന്റെ വളർച്ചയുടെ കാലമായിരുന്നു &#8211; ചെറിയ ചെറിയ കാൽവയ്പുകളും കുഞ്ഞു കുഞ്ഞു സന്തോഷങ്ങളും. വേർഡ്പ്രസ്സ് എനിക്ക് ഒടുവിൽ ‘നല്ല’ ഒരു ജോലി നേടി തന്നു. കൊച്ചി ആസ്ഥാനമായ ഒരു ടെക്‌നോളജി സ്റ്റാർട്ടപ്പ് എന്നെ അവരുടെ പ്രൊജക്റ്റ് മാനേജരായി നിയമിച്ചു. എന്റെ പ്രധാന ജോലി അവിടുത്തെ വേർഡ്പ്രസ്സ് വെബ്‌സൈറ്റുകളുടെ ഒരു ശൃംഖല നടത്തിക്കൊണ്ടു പോവുക എന്നതായിരുന്നു &#8211; ഞാൻ ഒത്തിരി സന്തോഷത്തോടുകൂടിയും ആത്മാർത്ഥതയോടുകൂടിയും&nbsp; ആ ജോലി ഏറ്റെടുത്തു. എന്റെ ബോസും, കൂടെ ജോലി ചെയ്യുന്ന ആൾകാരുമൊക്കെ എന്നെ ഒത്തിരി അഭിനന്ദിച്ചു. അങ്ങനെ വൈകിയാണെങ്കിലും ഞാൻ ജീവിത വിജയത്തിന്റെ ആദ്യ പടവുകളിലേക്കെത്തി. തുടർന്ന് പല ജോലികൾ ചെയ്ത ശേഷം ഒടുവിൽ ഇന്ത്യയിലെ ഒരു പ്രധാന പൊതു മേഖല ബാങ്കിൽ എനിക്ക് ജോലി കിട്ടി. ഈ സമയത്താണ് ഞാൻ ഒരു സ്നേഹനിധിയായ പെൺകുട്ടിയെ പരിചയപ്പെടുന്നതും അവളെ ജീവിതസഖിയാക്കുന്നതും. കല്യാണം കഴിഞ്ഞ് ഞങ്ങൾ ഒരു ഫ്ലാറ്റ് വാടകയ്‌ക്കെടുത്തു ഒരുമിച്ചു ജീവിതം തുടങ്ങി. ഒരു വ്യാഴവട്ട കാലത്തിനു ശേഷം ജീവിതത്തിലാദ്യമായി ഞാനും സ്വന്തം കാലിൽ ഞാനും നിന്നു തുടങ്ങി &#8211; എല്ലാ രീതിയിലും!&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>ഇതിനിടെ വേർഡ്പ്രസ്സ് എന്റെ മനസ്സിൽ നിന്നും പോയിരുന്നില്ല. ബാങ്കിൽ ഡെപ്പോസിറ്റുകൾ സ്വീകരിക്കുമ്പോഴും ലോണുകൾ നൽകുമ്പോഴും എന്ത് വേർഡ്പ്രസ്സ്, എന്ന് നിങ്ങൾ ചിന്തിക്കുന്നുണ്ടാവും. എന്നാൽ സമയം കിട്ടുമ്പോഴൊക്കെ ഞാൻ വേർഡ്പ്രസ്സ് പൊടി തട്ടി എടുക്കുമായിരുന്നു &#8211; അത് ഒരു പ്രത്യേക സന്തോഷം തന്നെ ആയിരുന്നു! എന്റെ റ്റ്വിറ്റർ ബയോയിൽ ഞാൻ അപ്പോഴും എന്നെത്തന്നെ വിളിച്ചിരുന്നത് ഒരു “WordPress guru” എന്നുതന്നെയാണ്. കുറച്ചു നാളുകൾക്ക് ശേഷം ബാങ്ക് ജോലി എനിക്ക് നന്നേ മടുത്തു. കരിയറിന്റെ അടുത്ത പടിയിലേക്ക് കാൽ വയ്ക്കാൻ സമയമായി, എന്ന് എനിക്ക് തോന്നി തുടങ്ങി.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>ഓട്ടോമാറ്റിക്കിന്റെ കടന്നുവരവ്</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>കരിയറിനെക്കുറിച്ച് ആലോചിച്ചപ്പോൾ എന്നിലെ വേർഡ്പ്രസ്സ് പ്രേമി ആദ്യം ആലോചിച്ചത് ഓട്ടോമാറ്റിക്കിനെക്കുറിച്ച് തന്നെയാണ്. ഇങ്ങനെ ഒരു കമ്പനിയുണ്ട് എന്ന് മനസ്സിലാക്കിയ ശേഷം കഴിഞ്ഞ ആറ് വർഷത്തിനിടയിൽ കമ്പനി വെബ്സൈറ്റിലെ ജോലികളെക്കുറിച്ചുള്ള പേജ് ഒരു നൂറു തവണയിൽ കൂടുതലെങ്കിലും ഞാൻ സന്ദർശിച്ചിട്ടുണ്ടാവണം. എന്തിനേറെ പറയുന്നു &#8211; പല തവണ ഞാൻ ജോലിക്ക് അപേക്ഷ അയക്കാൻ തുനിഞ്ഞതുമാണ്! എന്നെ പിടിച്ചു നിർത്തിയത് എന്നിലെ മുടിഞ്ഞ ആത്മവിശ്വാസമില്ലായ്മയായിരുന്നു. ഒരു സർക്കാരിതര സ്ഥാപനത്തിൽ ജോലി കിട്ടിയതിനു ശേഷവും കുടുംബത്തിലെ പുച്ഛത്തിനും പരിഹാസത്തിനും യാതൊരു കുറവുമില്ലായിരുന്നു എന്നത് തന്നെ കാര്യം! </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote><p>എന്നിൽ അടിയുറച്ച വിശ്വവാസമുള്ള ഒരാൾ മാത്രമേ ഉണ്ടായിരുന്നുള്ളു &#8211; അത് മറ്റാരുമല്ല &#8211; എന്റെ ഭാര്യ അർച്ചന തന്നെ. </p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>ഒരിക്കൽ രണ്ടും കല്പിച്ചു ഓട്ടമാറ്റികിൽ ജോലി ചെയ്യാനുള്ള എന്റെ അതിയായ ആഗ്രഹം ഭാര്യയോട് ഞാൻ പറഞ്ഞു. പുള്ളിക്കാരിയുടെ ഉത്തരം അക്ഷരാർത്ഥത്തിൽ എന്റെ കണ്ണ് നനയിച്ചു! “ചുമ്മാ അപ്ലൈ ചെയ്തോ, എങ്ങനെ പോയാലും ജോലി കിട്ടും &#8211; കിട്ടാതെ എവിടെ പോകാൻ?” ഇന്നും എന്റെ ഏറ്റവും വലിയ സുഹൃത്തും ശക്തിയും ആരാധികയുമൊക്കെ എന്റെ പ്രിയ ഭാര്യ മാത്രമാണ്! അർച്ചന അന്ന് എന്നോട് ഈ വാക്കുകൾ പറഞ്ഞിരുന്നില്ല എങ്കിൽ ഇനി നിങ്ങൾ വായിക്കാൻ പോകുന്ന സംഭവങ്ങൾ നടക്കുമായിരുന്നില്ല എന്നുള്ളത് പ്രപഞ്ച സത്യം!&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/4_First_ever_WP_Swag.jpeg\"><img /></a>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/5_Archana_Hari_Berlin.jpeg\"><img /></a>അർച്ചനയും ഞാനും\n\n\n\n\n<p>അങ്ങനെ രണ്ടും കല്പിച്ചു ഞാൻ കളത്തിലിറങ്ങി. ആദ്യം വേർഡ്പ്രസ്സ് വീണ്ടും പഠിക്കാൻ തീരുമാനിച്ചു &#8211; ജോലി കഴിഞ്ഞുള്ള ഒഴിവു സമയം ഞാൻ വേർഡ്പ്രസ്സ് പരീക്ഷണങ്ങൾ നടത്തുവാനും വെബ്‌സൈറ്റുകൾ നിർമിക്കാനും ഉപയോഗിച്ചു. അത് കൂടാതെ wordpress.org ഇന്റെയും wordpress.com ഇന്റെയും സപ്പോർട്ട് ഫോറങ്ങളിൽ ചോദ്യങ്ങൾ ചോദിച്ചിരുന്ന ആൾകാരെ ഞാൻ സഹായിച്ചും തുടങ്ങി, കാരണം എന്റെ ലക്‌ഷ്യം ഹാപ്പിനെസ്സ് എൻജിനിയർ തസ്തിക തന്നെ ആയിരുന്നല്ലൊ. തമാശയെന്തെന്ന് പറയട്ടെ, ബാങ്കിലെ ജോലി കാരണം കസ്റ്റമർ സർവീസ് എനിക്ക് നന്നായി പഠിക്കാൻ സാധിച്ചു. ഏതൊരു പ്രതികൂല സാഹചര്യവും നേരിടാനുള്ള ചങ്കുറപ്പ് എനിക്ക്&nbsp; നേടാനായി. ഒൻപത് വർഷമായി വേർഡ്പ്രസ്സ് ഉപഭോക്താവായിരുന്നിട്ടു കൂടി വേർഡ്പ്രസിന്റെ ലോകമെമ്പാടുമുള്ള കൂട്ടായ്‌മയെക്കുറിച്ച് എനിക്ക് അധികം അറിവുണ്ടായിരുന്നില്ല. അതിനാൽ ഞാൻ അതിനെക്കുറിച്ചറിയാൻ സോഷ്യൽ മീഡിയയിൽ പരതി തുടങ്ങി. ആയിടയ്ക്കാണ് ഹീറോപ്രസ്സ് (HeroPress) എന്ന ട്വിറ്റർ അക്കൗണ്ട് കാണാനിടയതും ഫോളോ ചെയ്തതും. ഫോളോ ചെയ്തപാടെ അത് എന്നെ തിരിച്ചു ഫോളോ ചെയ്തത് എന്നിലെ കൗതുകമുണർത്തി. അന്ന് വൈകിട്ട് ഞാൻ https://heropress.com സന്ദർശിക്കുകയും, വേർഡ്പ്രസ്സ് മൂലം ജീവിത വിജയം നേടിയ ഇന്ത്യാക്കാരുൾപ്പടെയുള്ള പലരുടെയും പ്രചോദനം നൽകുന്ന കഥകൾ വായിക്കുകയും ചെയ്തു. അവയൊക്കെ വായിച്ച ശേഷം എന്നിൽ ബാക്കിയുണ്ടായിരുന്ന ഭയവും ആത്മവിശ്വാസക്കുറവും പമ്പ കടന്നു.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>പൂർവാധികം മുന്നോട്ടു നീങ്ങാൻ തയ്യാറെടുക്കുമ്പോഴും എന്റെ മനസ്സിൽ ഒരു ചോദ്യം പൊങ്ങി വന്നു &#8211;

WordPress Executive Director Josepha Haden Chomphosy responded to recent public criticism the program has attracted. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>She referenced a <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/five-for-the-future-program-set-to-adopt-official-definition-for-pledges-and-contributions\">conversation</a> she began in May where she sought to make a clear distinction between ecosystem contributions and core project contributions. More recently, MasterWP editor Rob Howard characterized the program as &#8220;<a href=\"https://masterwp.com/toxic-scorekeeping-the-case-against-five-for-the-future/\">toxic scorekeeping</a>&#8221; following Matt Mullenweg <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/matt-mullenweg-identifies-godaddy-as-a-parasitic-company-and-an-existential-threat-to-wordpress-future\">identifying GoDaddy as a “parasitic company” and an “existential threat to WordPress’ future.&#8221;</a> </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The 5% in Five for the Future is aspirational,&#8221; Haden Chomphosy said. &#8220;Contribution to open source is a question and indication of privilege. So the 5% is not a requirement, but rather it’s an aim. It could refer to 5% of your time or 5% of your resources, or just any amount of your time or resources around. Regardless of how you’re defining it, it is an aspiration, not a requirement.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Haden Chomphosy also said that pledges indicate contributors&#8217; intentions but any amount they are able to offer is always welcome. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;No one is out there checking for 100% completion of the hours that you intended to give back to WordPress versus the hours that you actually succeeded at giving back to WordPress,&#8221; she said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;There are so many volunteers that make sure that this project is running and functional and has plenty of people knowing how to get things done and how to teach others how to get things done. It’s all coming from generosity of heart.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In Howard&#8217;s case against Five for the Future, he highlighted the disparity between Mullenweg&#8217;s recent remarks and Haden Chomphosy&#8217;s communication about the program. He proposed WordPress scrap the current pledge data and &#8220;stop keeping score.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;If WordPress and Automattic were really able to follow Josepha Haden Chomphosy’s example and treat the five-percent target as a fun aspiration without consequences, perhaps it would be valuable as a general guideline,&#8221; Howard said. &#8220;But Matt Mullenweg and other major company leaders clearly watch the scoreboard, and there is a risk that if your contribution is &#8216;not enough,&#8217; it can be brandished against you.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In today&#8217;s WP Briefing podcast episode, Haden Chomphosy said the initiative is directed at celebrating &#8220;a culture of generosity&#8221; and collaboration towards WordPress&#8217; long term health and stability. She clarified that her recent communications about the program were aimed at better identifying contribution activities and automating the process of giving props.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;For what it’s worth that discussion then also raised a third question that I don’t think we’ve even started to tackle, which is what about the activities that are not in the contributor network, but still do move WordPress forward?&#8221; Haden Chomphosy said. &#8220;Because there are so, so many of those things and it’s a great question. I don’t have an answer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The reality is that we won’t be able to see every contribution to WordPress, but that doesn’t mean that they aren’t valuable. And it doesn’t mean that they don’t matter.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In light of conflicting messaging, Haden Chomphosy has an uphill battle in attempting to reframe the program as part of a culture of generosity and bring it back to its <a href=\"https://ma.tt/2014/09/five-for-the-future/\">historical roots</a>. She concluded by encouraging listeners to embrace the program as she envisions it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;For me, it’s not about assessing the worthiness of people or companies or any of their contributions,&#8221; Haden Chomphosy said. &#8220;For me, it’s about reinvesting in the shared commons of the WordPress ecosystem, by finding a way that our economy can entice folks to put back into WordPress, something close to the benefit that they receive from it.&#8221;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 12 Jul 2022 02:49:15 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:17;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:71:\"Akismet: Version 4.2.5 of the Akismet WordPress Plugin is Now Available\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"http://blog.akismet.com/?p=2396\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:99:\"https://blog.akismet.com/2022/07/11/version-4-2-5-of-the-akismet-wordpress-plugin-is-now-available/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:669:\"<p>Version 4.2.5 of <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/plugins/akismet/\">the Akismet plugin for WordPress</a> is now available.

And welcome to the WordPress Briefing, the podcast where you can catch quick explanations of some of the ideas behind the WordPress open source project and the community around it, as well as get a small list of big things coming up in the next two weeks. I&#8217;m your host Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:00:40]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today I&#8217;m talking about Five for the Future– again. Before we get stuck right into the heart of it, 10 episodes ago, in episode 25, I focused on the Five for the Future initiative and I recommend that you listen to that before you join me in today&#8217;s episode. It&#8217;s only eight minutes and it gives you a history of the Five for the Future initiative, as well as some information on the Five for the Future program.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It then goes on to talk about some of the original intentions behind that original initiative. The reason I bring this back up today is partially because one, I will talk about both the program and the initiative it&#8217;s based on literally anytime. I believe strongly that they are both a vital part of what will result in a triumph of the commons of WordPress, and keep this empowering project around for years to come.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I also bring it up today because there&#8217;s conversation about a post I published a couple of months back that has generated some dialogue around the intentions of this catchy call to contribution. So to make sure that as we move through this discussion together, we are working with as much factual information as possible, I present to you some facts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:01:46]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First and foremost, the pillars of this initiative. The 5% in Five for the Future is aspirational. Contribution to open source is a question and indication of privilege. So the 5% is not a requirement, but rather it&#8217;s an aim. It could refer to 5% of your time or 5% of your resources, or just any amount of your time or resources around. Regardless of how you&#8217;re defining it, it is an aspiration, not a requirement.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second pillar, pledges show your intention and whatever contributions you are able to offer after you&#8217;ve made your pledge are always welcome. No one is out there checking for 100% completion of the hours that you intended to give back to WordPress versus the hours that you actually succeeded at giving back to WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are so many volunteers that make sure that this project is running and functional and has plenty of people knowing how to get things done and how to teach others how to get things done. It&#8217;s all coming from generosity of heart.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:02:52]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And speaking of generosity, the third thing that is important about this initiative is that it insists on and wants to celebrate a culture of generosity. Beyond the concept of a pledge, is the idea of generous collaboration toward the long term health and stability of our project for the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As contributors, we understand that we are greater than the sum of our parts and what we build <em>within</em> WordPress empowers those who build <em>with</em> WordPress. So those are the pillars that went into that initial thought, that opening Five for the Future call to action that Matt gave to everybody in 2014.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so now I want to share with you some of the pillars of the program that has grown up around it. So the Five for the Future initiative, if you&#8217;re not familiar, was started in 2014 and is a grand call to all of us to remember to give back to the shared commons of WordPress. Its aim was to help guard against what is called the “tragedy of the commons,” where resources are continually taken out and not necessarily reinvested in. No one&#8217;s necessarily putting anything back into those.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:04:06]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that&#8217;s the starting point for all of this. So the program, the Five for the Future program, in 2018 was built as a collaborative effort with full participation and buy-in from the contributors who were active in the project at the time. It allowed anyone to raise their hands, to show support of WordPress via a pledge and also started a multi-year discussion of how to define contributions in a way that let us automatically provide props and therefore more effectively put badges on people&#8217;s wordpress.org profiles.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then in 2019, there was an additional pilot of the program, which kind of offered some team structure, which was intended to not only take on work that I don&#8217;t like to ask volunteers to do, but also to provide some checks and balances to an absolute raft of sponsored contributor hours that we had started to see show up.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Which brings us then to the post that I mentioned at the start. Knowledgeable supporters of the WordPress open source project have debated next iterations to Five for the Future activity and programming. So, to bring the conversation to a central set of questions, or rather to bring the conversation to a central spot, I raised these two questions. One, what activities can we see inside our contributor networks? So wordpress.org, make.wordpress.org, the Rosetta sites that we have, Slack, et cetera.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:05:30]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what activities can we see inside the contributor networks that we can flag to enable easier distribution of props and therefore badges? The second question is, what activities can we see also in those contributor networks that appear to be contributions, but in the end are only benefiting the person or company that provides the contributions?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For what it&#8217;s worth that discussion then also raised a third question that I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;ve even started to tackle, which is what about the activities that are not in the contributor network, but still do move WordPress forward? Cause there are so, so many of those things and it&#8217;s a great question. I don&#8217;t have an answer and just so that I don&#8217;t leave you all with a series of questions for which there are no answers provided in this particular podcast, I do have a few answers for questions that I have seen floating around this discussion.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the first question is actually a bunch of questions. There are like three parts to it. What are props, who gives props, and who tracks them? So ‘props’ is a term used in WordPress to describe shared recognition of a contribution. Think of it as like a hat tip or kudos or an assist. However you think about it, it&#8217;s recognition of the other people who helped to solve a problem along the way. That is what props are.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:06:47]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second part of that question is who gives props and historically developers have given props, which tends to mean that it&#8217;s mostly developers who get props. But now, also, any team rep during a release cycle can provide props to folks on their team, volunteers on their team who were really helpful during the course of the release.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And recently we also added the functionality for ad hoc props to be given in the Slack props channel, and those get added to your profile activity. So that someone can give you basically a public thanks for having helped on something that they were working on. And then that gets logged in your activity tracker on your WordPress.org profile.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the final question in that first big question is who tracks these props? And the answer is human beings! Which is why folks feel like they have to do a ton of things before they even get props. And that&#8217;s also why I&#8217;d like to automate more and more of them so that you don&#8217;t have to do a ton of things in order for someone to show up and acknowledge that you are part of a solution.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:07:51]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the second question that I&#8217;ve seen kind of running around is, where do props start? And that is a great question that has been asked year after year. And one that I think we should continue to ask. The reality is that we won&#8217;t be able to see every contribution to WordPress, but that doesn&#8217;t mean that they aren&#8217;t valuable. And it doesn&#8217;t mean that they don&#8217;t matter.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Building our culture of generosity helps us to better recognize and celebrate each other for all of our contributions, whether they are for a major release or a major event, or one of these new ad hoc props that you can offer to people. And if we see more and more of the same type of contributions being celebrated, then we can also work toward automating those as well, so that you don&#8217;t have to do a super ton of them before someone has noticed that you&#8217;ve done even one of them.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the third big question that has been running around is, what about the people who don&#8217;t want the props? If people want to be literally anonymous, then deletion requests are probably your way to go. But I actually don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s the question here. I think the question is what if a prop holds no intrinsic value to you and then, you know, I wanna thank you for that spirit of generosity. And I also wanna say that I&#8217;m so glad you&#8217;re here.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:09:02]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hopefully, all of these answers clarify what lies at the heart of what is intended with the Five for the Future initiative and the program that&#8217;s built on top of it. And why I care so much about fixing the ways we offer props to folks. For me, it&#8217;s not about assessing the worthiness of people or companies or any of their contributions. For me, it&#8217;s about reinvesting in the shared commons of the WordPress ecosystem, by finding a way that our economy can entice folks to put back into WordPress, something close to the benefit that they receive from it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that brings us now to our small list of big things. Thank you all for making it into the final stretches with me. These three things that I&#8217;m sharing also have companion blog posts to go with them because they are very big questions or very big features, very big plugin kind of things that we&#8217;re looking at. And so you&#8217;ll be able to find those in the show notes, or you can go to wordpress.org/news if you&#8217;re listening to this in a podcast player of your choice that is not wordpress.org.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:10:10]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the first one on my list is a new plugin. It is called Create Block Theme. And it&#8217;s gonna make it easier for theme builders to use the existing site editor tools to create new block themes. I&#8217;m very excited about this. Uh, you can find it on make.wordpress.org/themes. And I will also include a link to it in the show notes below.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If themes are not your area of expertise, but you are interested in documentation or the DevHub or to an extent design things, then the improvements that are being worked on for the DevHub are definitely in your area. That&#8217;s kind of a Meta task, but has a few other pieces involved as well. That can be found on make.wordpress.org/meta. But again, I will have a link to the very, very detailed blog post in the show notes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s got a bunch of hypothetical changes that are being suggested for the WordPress developer docs, uh, especially when it comes to the function reference. And so there are gonna be some slight design questions, but not like, graphic design/visual design, more in the like, can humans read this design area of things? And so that will be a good one to look at. If you are sort of in the Meta or Documentation vein of things in the way that you like to contribute to WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:011:30]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the final thing is about open sourcing theme designs. So open sourcing everything obviously is important to us. And the design tool that we use, this tool called Figma, is open to the public. And so it&#8217;s possible for folks to be able to kind of get in there and use and reuse any design elements.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so there&#8217;s a discussion happening over on make.wordpress.org/design about how that can and should look in the future. And so if design is definitely your area, and again, this kind of lines up with themes a little bit, then wander over into that one, for which there will also be a link in the show notes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that my friends is your small list of big things.

And in today&#8217;s episode we&#8217;ll talk about the two latest Gutenberg plugin releases, WordPress 6.0.1, the create block theme plugin, and a lot more. I am Birgit Pauli-Haack, curator at the Gutenberg Times and WordPress developer advocate. And I&#8217;m here with my co-host, Mary Job, WordPress community organizer for WPafrica.org and support engineer at Paid Memberships Pro. Good evening, Mary, how are you today? And is there anything new coming from your community?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Mary Job</em>: Thank you, Birgit. So I&#8217;m slowly getting back into my work routine. I feel like this year has been a really long journey for me because every time I recover from a hit, I get hit again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Oh, no.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Mary Job</em>: Yeah, I&#8217;m looking forward to having more positive hits going forward for the rest of the year, I want to be hit positively, I don&#8217;t want any negative hits for the remaining part of 2022.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Oh, good. I wish you the best. Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Mary Job</em>: Yes. Thank you. So our meetup communities on the African continent are slowly getting back into momentum. I&#8217;ve been seeing a number of physical meetups, have come in. I know there is a WordCamp Ginger in Kampala, Uganda, that is scheduled for the first week of September. I&#8217;m most likely going to be there, it&#8217;s also going to be my first WordCamp post COVID, I&#8217;m looking forward to that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: All right. So WordCamp Ginger, and Ginger is near Kampala in Uganda?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Mary Job</em>: Yes, it&#8217;s not far from Kampala in Uganda.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: All right. And I looked it up on the WordPress site, it&#8217;s September 2nd and 3rd, and they have their speaker organizers and now volunteers and sponsor calls open. So if you are in the area and want to have your first WordCamp in Africa after the COVID pandemic, that&#8217;s where you can meet the people. So happy that the community bounces back now as well, not only Europe and America.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Mary Job</em>: Yeah, I am too. So for today&#8217;s special guest, I want to introduce Jorge Costa. He&#8217;s a WordPress co-contributor and developer for Gutenberg. He&#8217;s part of the Five for the Future team at Automattic. This week, Jorge worked as a list lead for Gutenberg version 13.6. Hello Jorge, thank you for joining us today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jorge Costa</em>: Hello. Thank you, Birgit and Mary, and for the invite for me to be here. I&#8217;m really glad to be here on this podcast, and also thank you for all the work you have been doing on this podcast. It&#8217;s an awesome way to let the wider community of WordPress know what we are doing on the Gutenberg plugin and get onboard, and test the things we are doing, and help us ship the best product possible. So thank you for all this work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Well, thank you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jorge Costa</em>: And thank you for the opportunity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Oh, you&#8217;re welcome. Thank you. It is always a great joy to kind of report on the stuff that the Gutenberg team puts out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Mary Job</em>: Absolutely. Plus one on that Birgit. So before we add into the changelogs of various release, we wanted to learn a lot more about you, Jorge. So my first question to you is this, can you tell us briefly your WordPress origin story, how did you discover WordPress and what happened next?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jorge Costa</em>: Of course, Mary. It&#8217;s a long story. So the first time I used WordPress, was in 2007, 15 years ago.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Mary Job</em>: Oh.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jorge Costa</em>: Yeah. I was still a teenager in high school, and then I tried to build some websites. At the time it was normal for people to have blogs, build some websites and try these things around. And I also did that, I tried to build some websites. WordPress was already one of the very popular tools at the time to build your website, and it had now some repository of free themes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So things that you could use without paying anything, you would not have problems changing or getting anybody, like cutting problems to you because you are changing some code somewhere. So I try some themes that shows what better fit the needs I had at the time. And basically it allowed me, without doing any design, I just put the theme there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It had the styles then on the content area, but the html I wanted and it looked more or less okay, not too bad, because the themes already contained most of the styles. And that was it, I learned to code this way, and I got the interest in code. I will never imagine at the time that some years later I will be a developer on the core product and going to conferences around the world, for example, the WordCamp U.S. where I met you, Birgit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jorge Costa: A long time ago. So after using WordPress, and I got this interest in coding, then I went to university, and it was part of the decision that I wanted to code things. And so I went to do a master&#8217;s degree in computer engineering. I work at for some companies after the master&#8217;s, and then I apply it to Automattic. And then here I am, that&#8217;s basically the story.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: So when did you start at Automattic?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jorge Costa</em>: Five years ago, in 2017.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: &#8217;17, yeah. And 2018, I met you at WordCamp U.S., yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jorge Costa</em>: Exactly. Yeah, one year after, in a rainy day. Yeah, it was raining a lot when we went inside the venue, with our clothes. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jorge Costa</em>: And they were really wet, yeah. It did feels like a long time ago, like with all the things that happen in the world, meanwhile.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, almost like last century. Right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Mary Job</em>: That&#8217;s a really interesting story. I think in 2007, I was struggling with hub pages. I think I discovered WordPress first in 2012, and I was like, &#8220;What is this? This is complicated.&#8221; And I ran away, I wish I stayed. So this brings me to my second question, Jorge, what aspect of Gutenberg do you work on, and what excites you most about this new way of creating contents and building sites?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jorge Costa</em>: Yeah, so I started working on Gutenberg in the early days, when the project still had only some mounts, and it was starting. So I touched on many parts of the code base and working on many of the tools that we have now. But there are some things that I&#8217;m really passionate about, and some are simple things, like the gradient pick or color pick, or all the things that allow you to change the font size, because these are the things that in the end will allow people to express what they are feeling in their website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We don&#8217;t want all the website on the internet to look the same, we want them to look good, but we want them to have some personality of the people that are doing them. If all the things were the same, it will not be as fun. And now that we are shipping block themes, people will have full control of their website, they will not need any line of code to implement basically any design they want.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And we can also put restrictions in place to make sure they have freedom to do everything they want, but it&#8217;s still output, something that is nice design-wise, and it looks good and looks professional. So I&#8217;m really curious, what these tools we put in place, what all these design tools will allow people to build.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Until now these things were built mostly by people, new code or were designers, then the coders try to pass that to code. I&#8217;m eager to see what people that don&#8217;t have any coding experience or any design experience will put out there, and what the new way it will appear. I&#8217;m certain we will be surprised when people felt this power with what they will do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, it kind of sets the creativity really loose. And as most listeners know, I love gradients. So, thank you. That was a while when, two years ago when the gradients come into to the block edit, and every time we saw in the changelog gradient, I was doing gradients. So I haven&#8217;t done this for a while, so I&#8217;m really glad I get an opportunity again. Yeah. And the color picker has really gone through quite some iterations. I really like what it&#8217;s doing now, to have all that in one place, and then open up the second pieces there.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Listener Questions</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Typography is about to shine even more with the site editor and the web fonts API say, yeah awesome. And in our show, we haven&#8217;t had a listener question for a while, Bud Kraus, a long time listener, a WordPress educator at Joy of WP, and also a contributor on the training team, he sent in this question, and I&#8217;m glad that Jorge is here to help us answer that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“So what&#8217;s all this I hear about bug right. What is all this I hear about Flexbox. I know about CSS and Flexbox, but how does this apply to the block editor? Is something special coming up concerning Flebox?” So again, thank you, Bud, for sending that in, and the good news is some of it is already here. So backup a bit, is Flexbox and CSS grid are features to implement intrinsic design and also build layouts easier.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I build layouts with table coding, but the first implementation of Flexbox with the block editor has already been implemented, and it&#8217;s the two block variations that come to the group block. One is called, Row, and the other one is called, Stack, and both help the user who have no idea about mobile breakpoints, pixel size and all that. And they also don&#8217;t want to spend a lot of time learning it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it&#8217;s part of the efforts for the developer team to implement responsive web intrinsic design. It&#8217;s also the start of the answer to a lot of questions I get from users or developers. So how can that be that there is no responsiveness in the block editor, and it&#8217;s actually here, it&#8217;s just a little bit differently implemented. But that&#8217;s the extent I know about things, and I&#8217;m glad to have you here. Jorge, can you enlighten us a little bit more how else this works?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jorge Costa</em>: Yeah, of course. So basically what happens is that the block editor, and it&#8217;s not exactly something new, it&#8217;s already part of core, and it was merged some months ago. So now as of allow blocks to specify the layout that they want for their nested areas, so they can opt into that, if they don&#8217;t opt into that, nothing happens. And they can opt into that feature, so the group block is already opting into this feature. And if you opt into this feature, you have a UI where you can choose different kinds of layouts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For now there are two layouts softwares, one is the default of flow layout, and the other one is the flex, which implements a Flexbox. And basically the user on the UI can control properties like the orientation, the justification, the width of the area. Then basically it&#8217;s converted to CSX. So that&#8217;s basically it, we are allowing the user to control some properties and allowing the user to have an easy way to create a flex layout, if the user wants to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some blocks offer that functionality. And block creators can also offer that functionality. That I am aware now we are not doing any active development on this feature, it&#8217;s already shipped, but it&#8217;s working well, now except for the team builders and block creators to use it, and there was some things with it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Thank you, Jorge. And thank you, Bud, for sending in the question. Hopefully that answers your questions, somewhat. And if you, dear listeners, also have questions you want us to tackle here on the podcast, ping me on direct message and Slack or on Twitter, or send me an email to <a href=\"mailto:changelog@gutenbergtimes.com\">changelog@gutenbergtimes.com</a>, that&#8217;s <a href=\"mailto:changelog@gutenbergtimes.com\">changelog@gutenbergtimes.com</a>. And by the way, also, if you like this podcast, we would appreciate if you could write a review on Google or Apple or Stitcher, it really helps to spread the word about the show. So, okay, that&#8217;s it from me. Mary, back to you.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Announcements</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Mary Job</em>: Oh, yes. Thank you, Birgit. So we&#8217;ll move on for that to the announcements segments of the show. We have a couple of announcements. First, the episode has two of the VP Tavern Jukebox. Put the episode title of the Jukebox into your podcast player. After our block theme workshop at WordCamp Europe, their CEOs have talks on it weekly on why you should try out block themes. She doesn&#8217;t say go all in with your site just yet, but you can get started exploring the new way to work with themes in a site editor. And that one is a great conversationalist, by the way, he asked all the right questions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the second announcement, the Pew Research Center has adopted a block first approach for their website, their lead developers Seth Rubenstein and their head of digital strategy, Michael Piccorossi will be guests at the next Gutenberg Times live Q and A, and demo their solutions for their own page. Their and chats on the July 22nd 2022 at 11:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time. This is also 1500 UTC. And Anne McCarthyi will be Birgit&#8217;s co-host for this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Oh, yeah. Thank you, Mary. Yeah, I&#8217;m so excited for this next live Q and A, especially because we had an eight-month break on live Q and A&#8217;s, and I hope you all join us. The link for the registration of course is in the show notes, and we will record the show and share it with YouTube and the Gutenberg Times. But there&#8217;s nothing better than getting the questions answered live, and your questions and not somebody else&#8217;s questions.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Community Contributions</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>So we are pointing out two community contributions today, one is a new, so there both are two new plugins that are in the repository, and come from core contributors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the first one is the create block theme plugin, it was built by the theme team, and in his write-up on the make theme block, Ben Dwyer covered the question of, who is it for? And he wrote, I quote, &#8220;This plugin is aimed at theme builders, both designers and developers, and it is useful for sharing your designs between multiple sites or users. If you are just building a site for yourself, you probably don&#8217;t need it.&#8221; So what does the plugin do? It has an export feature, right now it does the same things that the site editor export feature does.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also create a new giant theme with the activated theme as parent, and then you can create a new theme by cloning the activated theme, and then the resulting theme will have all the assets of the activated theme, combined with the user&#8217;s changes. Another feature is that you can save the user changes into the theme files, so you are practically overriding them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the feature will also delete the user changes from the database, so you get an immaculate theme again and have everything in one place. And then you can generate an empty theme, that gives you a clean slate to start off with, and for all the designs that you want. The plugin&#8217;s in the theme directory, and we have in the show notes links to Ben Dwyer&#8217;s write-up, and as well to the repository. Jorge, do you have any thoughts on this?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jorge Costa</em>: Yeah, I have. I think it&#8217;s awesome news, and it&#8217;s an important milestone. So until now to build a theme for WordPress, you needed to use an external tool, if nothing more, at least a text editor to call code your theme. And we are in a stage now where you can build WordPress themes with WordPress itself without using any tools. So you have the tool building itself. So I imagine soon we will have a default WordPress theme that was totally built with WordPress. So in fact, we will ship over price with parts of WordPress that were built with WordPress. So it&#8217;s like a strange loop, but it&#8217;s an awesome one to be in, it&#8217;s like we are in the stage where the tool is being self-sustained, and we can create the tool with the tool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: It&#8217;s like an encouragement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jorge Costa</em>: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: An inception, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jorge Costa</em>: Yeah, an inception. Let&#8217;s see what awesome things the community build, and it will be fantastic, themes being shipped to the repository, that were built poorly by WordPress with WordPress. So let&#8217;s see what will happen, but I think it&#8217;s very good news.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Mary, do you have any thoughts on it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Mary Job</em>: Yes. From the perspective of somebody who is a non developer, I was building in these websites for a few years. I would say, this is an awesome tool, and one that is&#8230; You know how we say, when you install WordPress, what are the basic plugins that you put on the site? This is one of such plugins that you should have on your site. And I think I&#8217;d argue differently from Ben, in the sense that if you&#8217;re building a website for yourself, you don&#8217;t really need this plugin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You actually do, because one of the things we say is when you&#8217;re starting a new project, you should always follow best practices. And one of such is themes, except because you never can tell, you might start, okay, I&#8217;m just building a simple site for myself and then it expands into something big. So you have to make sure you follow best practices. So I think this plugin comes in handy for individuals and business owners who manage their websites, and they no longer need to use charts and, I mean, you don&#8217;t have any excuse to not spin up a chart theme, you can do this on the fly with this plugin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: That&#8217;s a good point. Yeah. Thank you so much, Mary. And the second plugin I wanted to point out is, it&#8217;s called the Legacy Widget plugin, and it was built by Justin Tadlock. And he spent some time in the support forums and found a specific pain point that keeps people from testing block themes, that the Legacy Widget block is not available in the site editor. So many users couldn&#8217;t see how their widget sections would show up in the full site editing block themes that they got from the directory, and they weren&#8217;t able to put them in the templates or template parts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it takes a while, and many sites have third party widget sections from plugins, and not every plugin developer is up to the latest version and create blocks for their widgets. So until then the plugin, the legacy makes the Legacy Widget block available in the site editor, and now all the third party widgets are also available for your template and template parts. We have a write-up on that, on the Gutenberg Times, and as well as a link for the plugin in the repository.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jorge Costa</em>: It&#8217;s good news again. So for some context, I was involved in building the first versions of the Legacy Widget block, that is part of core and that the plugin uses to make its job. And at the start, we really wanted to allow people to use widgets anywhere. So the block was available in the post content, you could also use it on the site editor, and you could basically in any post or in any part of your block theme, you could have a Legacy Widget block, select the widget and use your widget, so you could add widgets everywhere.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;We wanted that to be the default, and we try really hard to make this work for most widgets. But in the end, there are some widgets where in their code, they say, &#8220;Do that, if I am on that specific screen that was on this page, or do that, if the dome of the page contains something.&#8221; And when you are adding to a totally different screen where these conditions don&#8217;t match and the page structure is totally different, the widgets broke, and there were some widgets.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although most widgets work out well, there were some widgets that because of this type of conditions did not work and there were crashes. If it is going to be a core feature, we cannot make it break with some types of widgets because we have a strong commitment to being backwards compatibility. So we made it only a possible to use it in some context where the possibility of it breaking was placed because these conditions match it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But now it&#8217;s a good trade-off, people have a plugin and if they really want to have this experience that works well for most of the widgets, they can install the plugin and use it. And if by any chance, some widget does not work well, it&#8217;s not exactly core that is breaking with their widget, it&#8217;s a plugin incompatibility issue, the Legacy Widget plugin and that widget are not working well together. And it&#8217;s also maybe widget developers, if they see their widget is breaking on the legacy, widgets maybe can change one line of code and make it work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jorge Costa</em>: So it provides a way for people to test it more easily. So I hope it&#8217;s going to get big usage, and it allows people to easily use their widgets and their block themes. Ideally, we will have blocks for everything, but in cases, blocks are not yet built, people can still use widgets, which is good news.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. That was the idea of everything goes into blocks. But there are some people, that takes a while to adopt and not every plugin developer has the bandwidth to get into block development so fast. So that was great, a background on the Legacy Widget block. Thank you, Jorge. So that brings us to our, what&#8217;s release section, and Mary, what do we have?</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>What’s Released</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Mary Job</em>: Yes. So first off, we have WordPress 6.0.1, release candidate. This was released on the 5th of July, and has 28 fixes. It will be incredibly helpful if listeners and committee members can help pass this version before the final release date, which is slated for the 12th of July. This is if you listen to this episode before the 12th of July. So what&#8217;s in this release? The nature of this minor release is mainly bug fixes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there was a fix, so the order that the color gap CSS is queued, so this is not provided by layout CSS in non block themes. There&#8217;s also several layout utility class themes, led to blocks that have their layout attributes specified. And on post comment blocks, There are also a couple of releases.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m not going to read all that, since we&#8217;re going to put it in the show notes. On post templates, there was a fix to the post templates to ensure that the layout blocks support for the post template block, it&#8217;s only applied on the outer most, and not on the first chart of each instance. Yes. Do you want to speak on this bug fix the last one here, Birgit?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: The fixed performance regression to remove widgets fragments?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jorge Costa</em>: It&#8217;s an important performance fix. So that was some lagging when you passed content, it&#8217;s a good announcement, and I think it&#8217;s probably one of the most notable fixes, like in the performance on this patch release.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Excellent.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Mary Job</em>: Thank you very much for expanding on that. So that&#8217;s it from the latest WordPress release and the release post, and it will be available in the show notes. Jorge, do you have any more thoughts to share on this?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jorge Costa</em>: Yeah, it&#8217;s a bigger than usual patch release, watching by the number of tickets that we included. And normally the patch was a little bit smaller, but I think in part that can be explained because of the very active development on more recent blocks, like the comments block, which most of the fixes are related to that. And then we also had lots of developments on the style engine and the styling output. So there were some specific issues that people reported, and that&#8217;s also another part of the patches. All in all, we did not have any very critical fix on this release, which is a nice thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there is some fixes, but none of them looks very critical. So I think what the best for the people would be to upgrade their websites, of course, so they can take advantage of all these fixes and they will not lose their time, they probably did not notice most of the bugs that we have on this list. But one day they may notice and they may be losing time, wondering why is this happening? So if they upgrade now, they will not lose their time wondering about the bug that was already solved. So as always, try to make your upgrades as fast as possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. There goes a big, big thank you to those who reported the bugs right after the 6.0 release. And of course, to all the contributors that kind of fixed them so fast, actually. It&#8217;s now five weeks after the 6.0 release, and that&#8217;s a really good time to have a minor release coming out, and now more people are going to use WordPress 6.0.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jorge Costa</em>: Yeah. That&#8217;s a good point for the listeners, they can now help us do the better product possible by testing the DRC that we have out. If you find any bug, you may make things easier for 40% of the internet that is going to run this code. So please test it and let us know if you find any issue with it.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Gutenberg 13.5</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Awesome. Thank you, Mary, for going through that release. So today we covered two Gutenberg releases. One is Gutenberg 13.5, and that was released two weeks ago, Anne McCarthy&#8217;s first release, congratulations to Anne. And there have been 12 enhancement and 15 bug fixes, and also an explosion of code quality updates, but they&#8217;re mainly related to the low dash refactors and updating some finals to the new ES land rules, and there were also a few PR&#8217;s for Gutenberg tools. But let&#8217;s dive into the selected enhancements.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One is, so the media tool tip on the image was not big enough to see actually what kind of image is the image file name, and now there&#8217;s a tool tip that shows the full URL of the image in the block toolbar of an image or a gallery, and I find that really helpful. For the cover block, this release added a placeholder when a featured image is in use, which is definitely helpful to see the better expectations on what you&#8217;re customized there. And another new feature, well, it wasn&#8217;t a new feature, it&#8217;s a better place for it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The add feature image toggled for the media replacement flow is now in the toolbar and connected with the media replacement dropdown before it was a separate button in the block tool, now it&#8217;s all in one, and it&#8217;s much easier to know, oh, I can just use the featured image for a cover block. The post navigation has now designed controls, that&#8217;s absolutely new. So post navigation block is the links on the single post page where users can navigate to the previous post or the next post, and now you can give it their distinct styling.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The theme development needs, however, enable to support through the appearance tools in the theme JSON, but now you have design tools for color, text decoration and font family. And of course, color for both the text and the link in that block. So if you have anything to say, Jorge, feel free to interrupt me in my flow and we&#8217;ll stop, and then you could say, because I know you have been working on some of the things. So it&#8217;s always welcome to chime in here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jorge Costa</em>: Thank you, Birgit, if I have anything, I will add.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: All right. So there&#8217;s also an APR that moves the CSS from the style sheet to the block definition, and that is helpful because it reduces the CSS specificity. Conflicts and theme developers can easily override them by other theme JSON files. The current themes are not touched with that, a change, so it won&#8217;t break anything, right now as the class names are still there and they&#8217;re still the same. So it&#8217;s a good change that does not break any layouts, so that is it what I see from the enhancements that I wanted to point out. There are plenty of bug fixes, as I mentioned.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is also a few fixes merged to improve the accessibility for the various interfaces, so context for the action buttons, for instance, in the template actions or the fix of the focus trap on certain input types, and also a label for the preview options in the dropdown, or increase the accessibility of the various features. And then I have one more, that is that also talking about CSS specificity, and there&#8217;s one fix that lowers the CSS specificity for the file block, as well as for the search block, meaning they are now following the button design that&#8217;s in the theme JSON, or in the CSS, and not have their own button styling.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So they are much more consistent now, unless you want to, as a theme developer, they are much more consistent now with the overall layout of the site. So I think, unless you have anything, Mary, or Jorge, from the 13.5 release, that&#8217;s all I had. It wasn&#8217;t a big release, it still had a lot of PR&#8217;s, but they&#8217;re all kind of backend stuff for code quality stuff.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Gutenberg 13.6</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>So let&#8217;s continue with Gutenberg 13.6 release, and Jorge, you were the release lead this week for it, and it comes with 34 enhancements and 24 bug fixes, and it also has code quality documentation items, and so on and so on. Do you want to kind of get started what you wanted to point out here?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jorge Costa</em>: Yeah, it&#8217;s a considerable release. There are some user, not of several things that are important to note. Right now you can add templates on the site editor. For all the posts of a specific post type, we are also adding the ability to select the template for posts of a given category. So all these things were already possible in the existing theme engine, but it will involve knowing the specific file names, knowing specific slugs to create these themes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So most people did not use these features. So when you say around websites on the internet, most of the category listings are the same, if you check the category of, like a shoes category compared to a dresses category, it&#8217;s almost the same, it just changes the posts. But now it will be easier to make specific templates with specific designs for each category or for each other.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I hope people start using these features more, it&#8217;s something you have a UI for it, you don&#8217;t need to create any files with the strange names, you just select on the UI, what you want to do. And then you create a template, or you make a small change to the general one that you want for on that specific case, all without involving any code, and having a way for it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jorge Costa</em>: So in 13.6, we started this expansion process for specific posts. It&#8217;s the work that is going to continue on the next releases. We also have the ability for you to, when you create a post, like the normal experiences for the post to start with a white screen, and on the last core release for pages, we have the ability for a pattern to say that the pattern wants to appear when you start a new page.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So when you start a new page, instead of starting from blank, you can have a UI that allows to select if you want a contact page and about page, or the most common patterns of a page, and then you just fill in the blanks and your page is then, it&#8217;s much more easier to start from something that was already built than having to build everything from the scratch. We received some feedback on the community that was nice, was useful, but people wanted it for any type of post type.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So for example, if you have a book post type, you may have many ways to show your book. For example, the cover of the book on the left, with the description on the right or the cover above with the description below. So what we offer with 13.6 is an ability, so for any post type, when you start creating a post type, you see a model and you can select the pattern that makes more sense to you. Or you can, of course, don&#8217;t select any pattern and start blank as you did before. So I think it will be very helpful for some users to have these type of patterns.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Absolutely. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jorge Costa</em>: So these ones are very noticeable features, and people can start using them right now, try them. We also have of course testing for part of the styles engine and theme JSON mechanism, which is something called Elements. It&#8217;s a concept, it&#8217;s still trying, but basically, you have a link on your post, that link can already be styled. It&#8217;s a cross block, like any block can have a link, you can have links on the navigation, you can have links on your post content, or you can have links to link to the pagination of your website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the same happened, and you can already customize it. But the same happens for buttons, you can have buttons outside of a button block, like the search block can have the button search, you can have other types of buttons, even in custom blocks. So these are the same for captions, like any block can have a caption. You can have a caption of a table, you can have a caption on the image. So these are elements that are generic and you can use it in any block.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And we want to allow people to easily style these types of things that are not block specific, but I may want all the captions of my website to look in a given way, or I may want captions of the images specifically of the images to look in a given way. So we are offering an API to do that, we ask people to give their feedback, test their themes, test their blocks, if things work now. And on 13.6, we provide already an UI for button, so you can already go to the site editor UI and try to change the colors of buttons and see if it is reflected on the search block.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>See if it is reflected on the third party blocks that you use, that have buttons. And we also have four captions, not a UI yet we are going to do it on the next releases, but as part of the theme JSON, and so in your theme JSON file, you can configure for the captions. And it&#8217;s two big things there. They are not featured highlights yet because it&#8217;s still something we are experimenting with.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And we are trying this type of concept. But feel free to test it, let us know what you think and share your feedback. Then we have many announcements, to make the UI more clear, simple things like some toggles have started having a description, complete one about what they do. So people know if they click that toggle, what is going to happen exactly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Things like when you schedule a post and you change your date for tomorrow, instead of the UI saying the day and the date telling you that the post is going to be published tomorrow, which is more clear, you don&#8217;t need to know what day is now and what day is tomorrow, and the UI, if it&#8217;s going to be published today at some hour, the UI is going to show you today at some hour.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Mm-hmm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jorge Costa</em>: So it&#8217;s the small things, but all the things done will improve the user experience and make things that we&#8217;ll probably not notice, but when they are there. But if we remove them again, you will probably start missing them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jorge Costa</em>: So that&#8217;s this type of announcement, many of them, we also have multiple accessibility features added. New keyboard shortcuts that you can use, which makes the application more accessible if you are using the keyboard a lot. We also document shortcuts that already existed, but we&#8217;re not being shown anywhere because they were probably added even before we have a UI to show these types of shortcuts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, yeah. Mm-hmm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jorge Costa</em>: So yeah, many small announcements. Also, there is lots of work happening around performance, but this work is not noticeable now, it&#8217;s like work for the long term. You are working but you will only see the benefits when that work is complete. I&#8217;ll talk you, it&#8217;s like long work, so it&#8217;s divided in multiple PR&#8217;s and this already contains many of these PR&#8217;s. So we hope when that work is complete, people will start noticing their editor is faster. And now we have also multiple bug fixes as always.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jorge Costa</em>: It&#8217;s part of the development process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Awesome.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jorge Costa</em>: Also many updates to documentation, like announcements, things that we think were important to be documented. There is a refactor of components to type script. So when people are coding for Gutenberg or using our components, their IDs will auto complete, will validate if they are passing the correct properties and the correct data to our components. So it will improve a lot, the developer experience for people building with our components and building complex UIs and complex blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Mm-hmm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jorge Costa</em>: And some announcements to the rest, API, remove hard coded strings that were there. And basically, there is lots of work happening, but mostly as we, with 3.5 too, it&#8217;s backend things, they need to be done to prepare the product, to receive the good UIs that they utilize.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Mm-hmm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jorge Costa</em>: But some of these UIs are not there and are not shipped yet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Thank you for the quick rundown here. I wanted to point out two more things. One is that the pseudo selectors on Elements, you pointed out them for theme JSON, but there&#8217;s also the pseudo selectors for, they are coming. Now I remember, it&#8217;s not yet in 13.6, it&#8217;s the pseudo selectors for the hover action and for the navigation links. So now I know that. So we talked about that. The other cover now has an axle top margin, top and bottom margin feature, so you can make the cover block larger, even if there&#8217;s not filled up with blocks, so you don&#8217;t have to use the spacer block anymore.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you use them, that&#8217;s fine, it doesn&#8217;t go away, but for new covers. And then pocket cast embeds are now possible, both on the core as well as on, Gutenberg has now the embed blocks for pocket cast. Pages podcast, as well as single episodes, so that&#8217;s nice. And I think we&#8217;re going to use them on the Gutenberg Times soon, to sprinkle out all the different episodes around the site. And we talked about the single custom post type templates. Yes. We talked about the keyword.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then there was one bug fix that the preview of the pattern didn&#8217;t show the dual tone that were already selected, so that has been fixed, so now you actually get what you see. No, see what you get when you have that pattern model up and preview some of the patterns. One fix is certainly something that&#8217;s also a quality of life fix is that the image block now preserves the all text that&#8217;s already entered in the media library on upload.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you don&#8217;t have to upload, punch it in again the second time for those who work quite a bit with images, that was kind of a little pain point, and it also didn&#8217;t add to the accessibility of the website when people forgot to use the all text, once they use it. Jorge already mentioned the documentation updates. One is, there&#8217;s actually an explanation how to set up the local environment to run the performance tests.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I think for those of us who want to contribute to Gutenberg and want to kind of double check things, and now you can do this also for the performance test. And Jorge also mentioned the style engine. There is now the documentation, it&#8217;s still experimental, but the team has added a correspondent documentation page for the style engine package. And it&#8217;s in the block editor handbook, and you can see some of the terminology that&#8217;s used for the style engine. Not sure do we want to get into that, what is the style engine, Jorge, can you summarize that a little bit?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jorge Costa</em>: Yeah, I can try to provide a small overview. So basically the style engine is a small piece of code, now not that small, but something that is aware of where the block is being rendered, what are the attributes of that block, and what are the styles applied to it. And then it receives this data structure with the style information that is represented in JSON most of the time. And it converts the structure to CXX, which is something that the browser then uses to render the block and apply the styles that is expected.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it&#8217;s basically a small compiler that turns your styles, data structure into CSX that the browser then shows to the user. You can imagine, for example, in a native application that where you wanted to render the blocks, you could have a different style engine that map this style structure to something instead of html and CXX, something native for that mobile platform. So yeah, it&#8217;s basically a small compiler of stands.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>What’s in Active Development or Discussed</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: All right. Okay. So that concludes the Gutenberg 13.6 release. Wow, and all the whole what&#8217;s release section. It wasn&#8217;t as exhausting as I thought it would be. So thanks for the great work of Mary and Jorge to kind of come along with us, or come along with it. So there is also excellent progress towards WordPress 6.1. So the estimates are, does Gutenberg 14.0, would be the last plugin release before feature freeze. And that&#8217;s actually only four more releases. So all of a sudden it gets still a little tight, for a feature freeze now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay, so what&#8217;s in the active development or what&#8217;s discussed is the next, so what&#8217;s coming up? There is an update regarding the web funds API. Just to do a little history on that the web funds API was worked on, but it was punted for 5.9, had a minimum implementation, restricted only to the theme JSON settings. And then the aim is to possibly get it into 6.1.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And you can follow along on the progress and on the roadmap with Tanya Mork&#8217;s tracking issue, which is 41476, but of course we have the link in the show notes and she provides there her shared vision, what the API supports the topography features for blocks, and then the themes, and also the tracking for the ongoing work for 6.1, that&#8217;s divided into things that need to be done for the architecture of the API, for the performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then talk about the future scope of it, are there already no bugs and documentation issues. So we of course have it in the show notes. But yeah, read up about it. And so you can follow along, tracking issues always kind of has all the open issues for a certain feature, and it&#8217;s definitely interesting for a theme and plugin developers what&#8217;s happening with funds in the near future. So Jorge, during the core editor chat, you shared what you have been working on, and there are some exciting features coming. Do you want to kind of go briefly through it, what you&#8217;re working on?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jorge Costa</em>: Yeah, of course. So one of the big features is expanding what templates you can create on the site editor, which I already referred to previously, and I talked about it already before. So that&#8217;s something that we are planning to take to the finish line and all the templates supported on the WordPress hierarchy can be created with a UI. Then we are also betting big on patterns.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Mm-hmm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jorge Costa</em>: So we want to provide the best pattern experience possible, which is a very complex engineering and user experience problem, because even defining what would the perfect experience be, is not a simple challenge. So basically when you have a pattern, no matter if it has 100 blocks, we want for it to be a cohesive structure where you can touch them and modify it as a single unit of content, instead of you not a seeing that it is composed by 100 different things, but we also wanted to allow to customize to change the contents of the patterns, offer some customizability.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that customizability, it&#8217;s something that the pattern can define, it&#8217;s not common for every pattern, it depends, in some patterns it may make sense to change almost everything in other patterns, it may make sense to only fill in the blanks, some texts that you already have there. As part of these experiments, one idea is to allow blocks, to output and to use any settings that we already offer on theme.json, so essentially, for example, in a group block that is used in a header, you would be able to say here in all blocks nested inside me, don&#8217;t have the ability to change colors, font sizes, everything.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you&#8217;ll essentially only be able to change the text and you&#8217;ll not be able to change the other things, so you don&#8217;t break the pattern, and you can also join that with our working mechanisms that already exist, so you really just fill in the blanks. That&#8217;s a way to offer this experience. There may be other ways where the pattern itself highlights what is relevant information onto descendant blocks and allow you to go there directly, and you just change what was said as relevant information. So we are working a lot on trying to define this pattern experience and make it as good as possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We are also going to include zooming out view where you, instead of showing your website and you scroll, you&#8217;ll see a zoom out where you view all your page or all your template with the sections that are part of it, and you can more easily have a new pattern that is a header or have a new pattern that is a folder replaced, big areas of design on your website. So that are the things, it&#8217;s work that is in progress, and we are hoping that soon the using patterns will be much easier and something more common to do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Well, that sounds exciting. Yeah, pattern is the way to go. Are you thinking also to have a UI, so people can create their pattern on the site and store it as a pattern, or because you can create reusable blocks and you can create template parts, but a user cannot create their own block patterns on the UI, is there some thought about that or a decision made?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jorge Costa</em>: Yeah, I think it&#8217;s something that makes sense, and if we don&#8217;t include it in core already, certainly there will be lots of plugins allowing people to do that. I think it&#8217;s something that we may have in core soon, it&#8217;s just that first we want to using the patterns be a very good experience, and then that&#8217;s like the cherry on top of the cake, it&#8217;s something that probably will happen. I&#8217;m not aware exactly there is a decision on it or not already.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, you&#8217;re right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jorge Costa</em>: Personally, I expect that it&#8217;s something that will happen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jorge Costa</em>: It&#8217;s a matter of time and making sure after the experience being perfect, or being the best we can, and I guess people will do that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Mary Job</em>: That would be a good one to see.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. But you&#8217;re right, Jorge, there are quite a few plugins actually allowing already the user who doesn&#8217;t touch code to create patterns or save a certain section, a group as a pattern so they can reuse it and then only have to change the text. But the locking of blocks inside a pattern, that&#8217;s already also possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking of locking, there is a new page in the documentation that outlines all the ways, how you can curate the block editor experience, especially also for the full site editing for as a developer for your clients or users in the block handbook. And I will share the link in the show notes as well, because that&#8217;s a question that comes up quite often, and now the block pattern somehow triggered my memory that I wanted to mention that. So, Mary, do you have anything that you wanted to add to what&#8217;s discussed or in the works?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Mary Job</em>: Oh yes, still on that, Jorge, George Mamadashvili is looking for technical feedback or a review, or his new PR to allow locking inner blocks from the container block. We&#8217;re going to put a link to that in the show notes. And there&#8217;s also a reminder from Nick Diego on editor box scrubs. This will take place at 1400 UTC. This is 10:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time, on Tuesdays in a call editor channel, on make WordPress Slack.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: All right. All good announcements and work to do. Speaking of locking inner blocks from the container block, having a little tog, and it looks like it&#8217;s a little toggle button that will have the user say, okay, and apply the same lock to all the inner blocks in a group block or in a cover block or something like that, so that is really good.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, I think we are at the end of a show. Thank you all for that, it&#8217;s a great show. I was so happy that we put it together today. I just want to remind everyone, July 22nd is our Gutenberg live Q and A with the lead developer, Seth Rubenstein and head of digital strategy, Michael Pickerosy from the Pew Research Center. And my co-host will be Anne McCarthy, and the registration and link is in the show. So Jorge, Jorge-</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jorge Costa</em>: That is always this confusion between Spanish and the Portuguese version of the name.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: I&#8217;m sorry, I butchered it probably, either way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jorge Costa</em>: Either way is fine, I&#8217;m already accustomed to it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: So if the people want to get in contact with you, want to kind of ask you questions, or how is the best way to reach you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jorge Costa</em>: Yeah. You can reach me on the WordPress Slack, Jorge Costa, or you can reach me on Twitter too, JorgefesCosta, and of course on GitHub, George Filipe Costa, which is my GitHub username. So feel free to reach on any of the platforms you like.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: All right. And Mary, do you have anything that you wanted to remind our listeners about that you didn&#8217;t get in beforehand?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Mary Job</em>: No.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: All right. So how can people reach you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Mary Job:</em> Maryojob on Twitter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Maryojob. Yes, Maryojob on Twitter.

I am most excited about meeting people at WordCamp US in San Diego, the WordPress 6.1 release and some downtime around the Holidays. But first it is vacation time in August! We will meet family and friends in Berlin, Munich, Black Forest and Merano, Italy. In between we sprinkle our workdays, too and some weekend editions. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This week, there are some real gems in the list of posts. The list of WordPress events is quite long, with more in-person WordCamps around the world, additional July events on the Social Learning space and more. Check them all out on the bottom of this edition. And don&#8217;t forget to <a href=\"https://us02web.zoom.us/webinar/register/7216548519021/WN_Af50AS7VQbuyCrUdQnormw\">reserve your seat for the next Gutenberg Times Live Q &amp; A</a> with the folks from the Pew Research Center.  Hope to see you there! </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hopefully, you also get some vacation time and no screen-time in this Summer.

Food blogs commonly have a strong focus on category and tag-driven grid layouts with big featured images and multiple sections showcasing different types of recipes. Prior to the block editor, customizing these types of layouts would be beyond reach for most WordPress users. They would have to rely on the theme to provide the right layout or enough user-friendly options to change it.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\"><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/block-patterns-for-food-bloggers/\">Block Patterns for Food Bloggers</a></blockquote>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>This plugin offers 19 beautifully designed patterns that are fully customizable, making it easy for food bloggers to create complex layouts. Once installed, users will find a little icon at the top of the editor, which  launches the patterns in a modal.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>The modal displays a grid view of the patterns, a list view with larger images, and allows users to preview the patterns with a mobile, tablet, and desktop view.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>Patterns look exactly like the preview when you select and insert them. They include all the images and text so users don&#8217;t have to guess how it all fits together. Most patterns simply require replacing the content with your own but can also be used as a starting point for additional customizations. For example, users can drop in this set of featured categories and edit the links to their own categories. </p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>Some of the patterns, such as the different post grids, will require users to make some edits to the block settings for the Query Loop to get it to display the specific categories, author, post type, etc. </p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>The plugin also includes two different &#8220;About Me&#8221; style Hero sections for introducing the food blogger, as well as an Instagram profile pattern with a small grid of images, and a book feature. There are patterns for a newsletter signup design, and a search form design with a browse section and quick search categories. </p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>Check out the <a href=\"https://demo.wpzoom.com/foodica-patterns/\">demo on WPZOOM</a> to see all the food blogger patterns in action and an example homepage created with only the patterns in the plugin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Block Patterns for Food Bloggers is a fun plugin to play with because all the patterns are harmonious to each other, so it doesn&#8217;t look like they were all mixed and matched from different plugins. They should drop seamlessly into any WordPress theme or can be used on a blank canvas style theme without an issue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are food blogger who is eager to build your own website but have not found a theme that works for you, this plugin could be all you need to make your own layouts. It covers everything from recipe index pages to featured sections that you would find on any food blogger&#8217;s homepage. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>WPZOOM published a few helpful tips on the plugin page for customizing the patterns:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Use the Group block to control spacing and color for more than one block at a time.</li><li>Use the Cover block to control your pattern’s height, including min-height and full-viewport designs.</li><li>If your pattern contains numerous root-level blocks it can be helpful to Group them all together. This makes it easier to move your pattern around once inserted.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Although these patterns are presented with food pictures and placeholder text, they could easily be used for any other type of website. If you have a custom post type for movies, books, portfolios, team members, or any other kind of content, these patterns may be just as relevant. </p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>Although some might contend all these patterns should be uploaded to <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/patterns/\">WordPress&#8217; official pattern directory</a>, I can see the value of offering them as a unified collection in a plugin.  Patterns mashed together from the Patterns Directory do not always have a unified design. There are already a few plugins that offer general pattern collections but it would be great to see more niche pattern collections like this one with a unified focus and design. It makes page building much easier than simply relying on core blocks and block collections.   </p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/block-patterns-for-food-bloggers/#description\">Block Patterns for Food Bloggers</a> is available for free from the WordPress Plugin Directory. It works just as advertised and does not include annoying upgrade advertising in the admin.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 08 Jul 2022 21:56:41 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:23;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:44:\"Post Status: Join the Incident Response Team\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:32:\"https://poststatus.com/?p=100597\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:55:\"https://poststatus.com/join-the-incident-response-team/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:376:\"The now-forming Incident Response Team (IRT) is a community-led effort to help us all build and sustain a culture around WordPress that is healthy, inclusive, and safe.

href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/07/07/whats-new-in-gutenberg-13-6-6-july/\">Gutenberg 13.6</a> was released this week with an expansion of full-site editing features and 26 bug fixes. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the highlights includes the addition of the pattern modal for users when they create new content within a custom post type. WordPress 6.0 introduced the ability to display patterns in a modal when a user creates a new page. The idea is to give them an optional jump start instead of just a blank page. In Gutenberg 13.6, this feature has been expanded to include custom post types, which developers can enable selectively.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />image credit: <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/07/07/whats-new-in-gutenberg-13-6-6-july/\">Gutenberg 13.6 release post</a>\n\n\n\n<p>The other headline feature for this release is the expansion of template types in the Site Editor. Users can now create a template for all of the posts of a specific post type. This is a major enhancement for WordPress&#8217; underlying CMS features, as it allows more customization than ever before without having to edit any code or know how to create custom templates. Version 13.6 also introduces the ability to create a template for a specific post.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>Gutenberg contributors have a <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/37407\">roadmap</a> for how they want to expand the available template types in the future beyond this update. It includes individual author templates, post type archives, and general/custom templates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other improvements include new keyboard shortcuts for Strikethrough and Inline Code, an updated post scheduler UI that says “Today” and “Tomorrow” when applicable, and template selection UI updated to be a popover. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The capabilities of theme.json have been expanded to include global control of button styles to change their appearance sitewide. Third party blocks with buttons that use the correct markup can also have their buttons included in sitewide style changes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Captions can also be controlled using theme.json as of Gutenberg 13.6. Future releases will add a UI so that users can easily manage caption styles sitewide.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For a more detailed breakdown of all the enhancements and bug fixes in 13.6, view the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/07/07/whats-new-in-gutenberg-13-6-6-july/\">release post</a> or check out the <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/releases/tag/v13.6.0\">full changelog</a> on GitHub.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 08 Jul 2022 02:03:11 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:29;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:61:\"Post Status: Post Status Comments (No. 12) — WordPress Lite\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"https://poststatus.com/?p=99795\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:38:\"https://poststatus.com/wordpress-lite/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:402:\"What if there was a \"lite\" version of WordPress that was still WordPress — still customizable under the hood but tuned up for a great user experience for particular use cases?

After an eight-month hiatus, the show will return with guests who are doing some exciting things with Gutenberg out in the wild.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Pew Research Center is a non-profit organization that conducts public opinion polling, demographic research, content analysis, and other data-driven social science research. Producers and designers publish polls, charts, and findings through the organization&#8217;s website. Its unique use of custom and core blocks empowers them to create and publish interactive formats with minimal involvement from developers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michael Piccorossi, Director of Digital Strategy at the Pew Research Center, will be a featured guest along with his colleague Seth Rubenstein, who leads development. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In May, Rubenstein tweeted a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SethRubenstein/status/1529294274751348736\">thread</a> demonstrating how the Pew Research Center is using Gutenberg. The homepage, which has a magazine style layout, along with the topic pages, were all built with the block editor. He also gave a quick editor demo of an updated block version of the organization&#8217;s Political Typology Quiz, which Rubenstein said is their most complex digital product.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Last fall we launched an updated version of our most complex digital product, the Political Typology Quiz.

This frees us up to build even more and gives us more time to maintain/improve functionality.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Pew Research Center&#8217;s development team does not plan to open source all of its block library but will be open sourcing their new Gutenberg-powered chart builder plugin (demonstrated below). </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">By end of summer we\'ll be launching two new \"quote sorter\" interactives that will be our first built out in Gutenberg.

We&#8217;ve spent the last three years going &#8216;all in&#8217; on block development.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;This may seem like overkill, but it forced us into a block first approach that means by end of this fall we&#8217;ll be ready to go all in on full site editing, which just means we can do more with fewer people and more consistently and better than before.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Gutenberg Times Q&amp;A session will cover how the Pew Reach Center streamlines its publishing process through a mix of core and custom blocks, and how they create powerful charts and quizzes. It will be hosted on Zoom at 11:00 AM in&nbsp;<a href=\"javascript:;\">Eastern Time (US and Canada)</a> and is free to attend with <a href=\"https://us02web.zoom.us/webinar/register/4916571987471/WN_Af50AS7VQbuyCrUdQnormw\">registration</a>.

The new theme, <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/davis-blocks/\">Davis Blocks</a>, is sporting the same clean design as its predecessor, and can be used as a starter theme or a lightweight blog theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>Norén said he built Davis Blocks to be as small as possible, while retaining the same appearance as the original theme. The updated theme has no JavaScript and weighs just 248K, most of which is the PT Serif font files and the theme screenshot. It stands in stark contrast to Norén&#8217;s first block theme, <a href=\"https://andersnoren.se/teman/tove-wordpress-theme/\">Tove</a>, which was loaded with 52K custom CSS.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The promise of block themes is that eventually, themes won’t need to include any custom CSS at all,&#8221; Norén said. &#8220;A basic theme, without any custom block styles, should be able to get by just by using theme.json. Core is not there just yet – there are a couple of blocking issues, like alignment styles – but it’s getting pretty close.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Norén&#8217;s <a href=\"https://andersnoren.se/introducing-davis-blocks/\">introductory post</a> for the theme covers many of the current challenges block theme authors face, such as structural issues like giving alignments to an outer margin on smaller displays, the necessity for overwriting some core styles, the inability to style buttons in the file and search blocks with theme.json settings, and more. He is eager to remove more of the CSS included in Davis Blocks as these issues are resolved.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although Norén identifies Davis Blocks as a classic blogging theme with an emphasis on typography and long-form articles, it can be transformed into any kind of theme thanks to its support for full-site editing features.  Users can easily customize the header and other templates to add or remove blocks and change the color scheme to suit their own needs. </p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>Davis Blocks is packaged with six template files (404, Archive, Index, Page, Search and Single) and three template parts (Header, Footer, and Loop). Although there has been a lot of buzz around how indispensable patterns have  become, Norén opted to forego including any in this theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;With the progress being made on the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/patterns/\">WordPress.org pattern directory</a>, bundling block patterns in the theme folder felt like a step in the wrong direction,&#8221; he said. More than 800 patterns are now available in the directory, so it will be interesting to if other block theme authors go in a similar direction or insist on including their own custom patterns.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/davis-blocks/\">Davis Blocks</a> is available for free from the WordPress Themes Directory and can also be installed via the admin Add New themes menu. The addition of Davis Blocks brings the directory&#8217;s count of block themes to 91.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 06 Jul 2022 20:22:24 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:33;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:133:\"Post Status: A Better REST API, Improving Developer Docs, Open Sourcing Theme Designs, WebP and multiple MIME type support for images\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:32:\"https://poststatus.com/?p=100458\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:141:\"https://poststatus.com/a-better-rest-api-improving-developer-docs-open-sourcing-theme-designs-webp-and-multiple-mime-type-support-for-images/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:148:\"Do you want to see the REST API improved?

David is the Web3 lead at Automattic, which is a new role. He&#8217;s trying to understand what Web3 is and how it&#8217;s going to alter the course of the internet in the future. You might&#8217;ve heard of Web3 and be confused about what it is exactly. DAOs, NFTs, smart contracts, Layer2s, and DeFi. These are all terms associated with Web3. But they&#8217;re not necessarily well understood. It&#8217;s complex. These technologies go about things in new and innovative ways.

We were competing against crowds and the air conditioning. And whilst the podcast is more than listable. I hope that you understand that the vagaries of the real world we&#8217;re at play.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in finding out more, you can find all of the links in the show notes by heading over to WPTavern.com forward slash podcast.

Hello?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:39] <strong>David Lockie:</strong> Hi Nathan how you doing?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:40] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, really good. Day two of WordCamp Europe. You&#8217;re the first person that I&#8217;ve been able to actually say to, how&#8217;s the conference been going so far?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:47] <strong>David Lockie:</strong> It&#8217;s been great. It&#8217;s been really nice just to see everyone again. I was mainly on the stall yesterday on the booth, the WooCommerce booth. I haven&#8217;t been to any talks yet. And so I can&#8217;t speak to the conference content, but just the experience of being around everyone of there being booths, of there being people like, it&#8217;s like jacking into the main line of excitement around WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I&#8217;m I&#8217;m loving it. A hundred percent.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:12] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Just give us a little bit, very briefly of your background with WordPress. Just to paint a picture of why you are here today and where the authority comes from.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:19] <strong>David Lockie:</strong> Sure. I&#8217;ve been in the WebPress space about 15 years. I was a freelancer, and ran an agency called Pragmatic. I have been an entrepreneur in the space and I&#8217;ve been a marketer in the space as well. In terms of blockchain, crypto web three, I&#8217;ve been interested since about 2017, and over the intervening time I have become co-chair of the Beamer Blockchain Council. That&#8217;s the British Interactive Media Association.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I advise a couple of startups in the space, and most recently I&#8217;ve been really fortunate to be able to bring those two worlds together by joining Automattic as web three lead. It means that I can keep working on the technology in the community and the ecosystem that I love, but also have a chance to work on technology that I&#8217;m excited about and believe will inevitably disrupt and join with WordPress. So it&#8217;s a real privilege to have that opportunity to kind of marry both my tech loves together.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:15] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Nice. Now I think there&#8217;s a fairly low chance that somebody listening to this will not have heard the words web three, but I think there&#8217;s a fairly high chance that they won&#8217;t actually understand what that means, myself actually included.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve heard it. I&#8217;ve got the peripheral understanding. I&#8217;ve never bitten down into the middle of it, and probably I think I&#8217;ve got some misunderstandings that need cleaning up. So, just for a minute just tell us basically, if you can, probably without consuming the entire half hour podcast, tell us what web three is in it&#8217;s highest possible terms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:44] <strong>David Lockie:</strong> There are a bunch of different definitions. The one that I use is that it&#8217;s a family of decentralized technologies that allow people to coordinate in new and interesting ways. That&#8217;s a little bit more ethereal. A more practical, tangible definition would be technologies built on blockchains and related decentralized technologies. But the decentralization is at the core of everything that we talk about with web three.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also feel a bit funny about the kind of blockchain, crypto, web three rebrand, because actually I think there are other very significant technologies that are coming down the line and will sort of converge as web three becomes more mainstream. Things like 3d things like AI. That means that when we&#8217;re talking about web three, it&#8217;s not simply an evolution of where we are in terms of the centralization, but it&#8217;s also this sort of new immersive experiential realm in which ownership and rights and value transfer and transactions all become part of a very rich tapestry that will feel like a new evolution.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For me, before the kind of blockchain web three rebrand, I used to talk about web three as the day when people stopped walking down the road, looking at their phones because they&#8217;re wearing glasses and it&#8217;s more ambient and immersive. So even to myself, I have a few different concepts of what it means, but decentralization is the key when people usually talk about web three.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:00] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I see web three written in two different ways and I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s different. So I see web three as in W E B, no space 3. And I see web 3.0. Is there any separation there or are they exactly the same?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:13] <strong>David Lockie:</strong> I</p>\n\n\n\n<p>think it&#8217;s just exactly the same I&#8217;m old enough to remember when web two was the excitement um and being in O&#8217;Reilly conferences in Berlin, and it was web two dot, that was like the hotness. And of course there was never like a web 2.1 or</p>\n\n\n\n<p>web 2.5 And so I think web 3.0 is similarly redundant.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:32] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, it seems to me that inside of the web three space is a bunch of acronyms and a bunch of different technologies. So I&#8217;ve written down a couple here and none of them, I particularly understand.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I&#8217;ve got DAOs, got NFTs, I&#8217;ve got contracts, I&#8217;ve got something which was completely new to me, Layer 2s, and DeFi. Are these if you like sub domains of web three, are these just component parts that sit inside of it, or are they completely separate autonomous pieces?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:59] <strong>David Lockie:</strong> I think that&#8217;s a really good observation. And I guess the genesis of that is that the blockchain technology, which supports all of the rest of web three has a bunch of new terms and new concepts in it of itself. A blockchain is a new concept. A Merkel tree is a cryptographic term that unless you&#8217;re a researcher you wouldn&#8217;t know about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The idea of cryptocurrencies and tokens and cryptography, some of this stuff, it was just not in the everyday parlance, and the things which have evolved from that, decentralized autonomous organizations, decentralized finance, non fungible tokens, smart contracts, layer zeros, ones, twos, scaling solutions, bridges, automated market makers. All of these things, they&#8217;re not just new words, they&#8217;re new concepts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think that&#8217;s part of what people struggle with when they&#8217;re getting their head round web three, is that it&#8217;s very fundamentally different. The whole nature of it, the decentralized nature of it means that things change in a very profound way. And so there is like a massive vocabulary to get your head around and that can feel quite daunting, quite inaccesible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And obviously you&#8217;ve got like the label for things, but then understanding what actually sits behind DeFi like, how is it different from traditional finance? How does it work to have a financial system that is entirely controlled by open source software? These are just brand new things. And so all of that terminology and all of those concepts are just things that you have to get your head around.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think people in this space often talk about this sort of rabbit hole where people can dance around on the surface and see the results of some of this stuff. Pictures of monkeys being worth millions of dollars, or like scams taking hundreds of millions of dollars by a smart contract floor. And so they form their judgments about this stuff, but actually when you find something that&#8217;s of interest and you follow that thread, you go down and the hole is long and varied and complex and ever changing. And the conversations that you have with people that have gone down that rabbit hole and haven&#8217;t, they just feel utterly different.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You have a different, like a different, basis for the conversation. And I guess that&#8217;s one of the things which people find challenging about the space as well like, people already naturally form cliques and geek out and, in group out group stuff. And I think. If you have a negative perception, for whatever reason of what&#8217;s happening in this space, then it&#8217;s very easy to feel excluded.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that it&#8217;s just all this nonsense going on and you don&#8217;t wanna engage with it because it&#8217;s just too much. Like it&#8217;s a lot. It&#8217;s really a lot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:28] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah. I think that&#8217;s a part of the puzzle for me. When web two came along and social happened, you could completely get it. And it took a while for the harm of all of that to become obvious. What I&#8217;m seeing in the press at the minute is the inevitable backlash. I&#8217;m seeing people&#8217;s wallets being emptied and certain blockchains becoming disrupted and all sorts of negative press.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Six months ago I felt there was a tidal wave in the opposite direction. It was just positivity, just Bitcoin, crypto, NFT. This is all brilliant. It feels to me at the moment as if we&#8217;re riding a wave of, hang on a minute, there&#8217;s danger here if you&#8217;re not careful, if you&#8217;re not thoughtful, if you don&#8217;t understand what you&#8217;re doing. And so that I suppose is a concern that maybe you&#8217;re gonna have to be confronting in your role in the near term.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:14] <strong>David Lockie:</strong> It&#8217;s definitely something that&#8217;s on my mind. But this is far from the first cycle in crypto as well. And I guess having lived through the previous cycle, the 2017, 2018 and then right through to 2019 where everything started lifting up again. There were very clear patterns and they follow typical economic cycles as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You get the positivity and then the overexuberance and then the sort of speculation, like the top. And then, there&#8217;s some bad news and then suddenly everyone starts getting fearful and the fear is a positive feedback loop. And so the price dumps and everyone gets scared and bored and runs away.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But all that is like the bottom of that cycle. And then out of that will come, like in the UK, a new use case. New people with new funds, new ideas. Projects that were worked on during the bear cycle start to come to fruition. So we saw this with the previous cycle was really around, for me, it was around Ethereum and starting to see the promise of smart contracts and NFTs and some of this sort of the web three, rather than just Bitcoin price action.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And this time round was catalyzed by decentralized finance and then continued into NFTs. So it could be, a pretty wintery situation for a couple of years. But then new use cases, new projects will emerge and we&#8217;ll be up and at &#8217;em. And if you average out, the actual use of this technology, it doesn&#8217;t align brilliantly well with the market action, like the price action. It&#8217;s still going up and to the right, obviously like with some ups and downs, according to how exuberant everyone is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I guess that&#8217;s one of the things that&#8217;s sort of interesting is that it&#8217;s a very integrative technology, in that it is economic, is technological, is also social as well. It&#8217;s the first 24, 7 global permissionless marketplace for people to do stuff, whether that is financial stuff or coordination stuff or whatever. It&#8217;s the first time that we&#8217;ve been able to do that with meaning attached to it like economic meaning.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we&#8217;ve been able to do that with WordPress, with open source development for decades. And that&#8217;s been insanely valuable to everyone as a result. One of the challenges with web two is that we were creating all of this value, but there were no direct internet native ways to try and capture and program that value.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we relied on all these secondary business models. Particularly advertising and data collection to extract or convey some of that value around what was essentially an economy, but with no native currency to exchange. And I think that&#8217;s one of the, the most profoundly interesting things that web three does is it allows us to underpin, not overlay, but underpin everything else that we do online with internet native programmable money that can serve all the different use cases that we have now and into the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:55] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Do you feel that things like blockchain, decentralized ledgers and all of that is a clever idea, but is still trying to actually find a use case, which is useful for most people? Again, we&#8217;re harking back to the weird things that happened like NFTs and so on. That just strikes me as a bizarre use case, but the decentralized block chain, the idea of a ledger which is imutable and everybody can inspect and see. It feels like that&#8217;s got a lot of uses, we just haven&#8217;t figured out what they are. Practical, useful things for most people in the same way that the web is practical and useful for most people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It feels to me at the minute, it&#8217;s a stretch to get, for example, my mother to have any interest in web three because the barrier&#8217;s too high. The weirdness is too much. And maybe we&#8217;re just waiting for that golden apple, somebody comes up with something. Oh, that&#8217;s remarkable. That&#8217;s brilliant. Everybody can get ahold of that. I just wonder if that epiphany hasn&#8217;t happened yet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:51] <strong>David Lockie:</strong> I think it&#8217;s a, an interesting question. There are definitely elements of, and it&#8217;s a bit of a kind of web three trope. Like it&#8217;s still early, there&#8217;s still lots of innovation ahead of us. Like maybe there will be that killer app that suddenly everyone goes, oh, this is why blockchain&#8217;s important in our life. This is why web three&#8217;s important in our life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, if you look at a lot of internet infrastructure and web infrastructure, like most people don&#8217;t understand the importance of any technology, really. They just jab at buttons on their phone and things happen as a result. But that doesn&#8217;t mean that the underlying technology isn&#8217;t important. People just wanna write a WordPress post.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They don&#8217;t care about this pull request or, whether it&#8217;s Gutenberg or classic editor. They just want to do a job. So I think there&#8217;s an element to which a lot of people will never need to know or need to care about web three. We may well see some like breakthrough use cases.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Personally, I do think NFTs and digital collectibles are gonna be one of those breakthroughs. We&#8217;ve seen it this cycle. Instagram is teasing at an upcoming release about allowing people to display and eventually to buy and sell collectibles on Instagram. If that rolls out to 3 billion people, that&#8217;s mass adoption.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They&#8217;ve got a patent in for meta pay, which is their own payments, digital wallet and digital currency exchange infrastructure. But even then, like people might not know that is all part of blockchain. They might not understand the technology that&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:12] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> It&#8217;ll still be a button on a screen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:14] <strong>David Lockie:</strong> Still be a button on a screen that they can use to buy a thing from the brand or the creator that they love and want to support or the clothes that they wanna wear. But I also think that there&#8217;s another aspect to it, which is that the world is not without its challenges right now. And things which don&#8217;t seem important now might suddenly become incredibly important. And we can always look at the edges to see where the innovation and the use cases are.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So for example crypto has a very valid use case now of international remittence. So if you are a migrant worker, you&#8217;re working another country, we need to send money around the world. You can do that more safely and cheaply using crypto. And that&#8217;s what a large proportion of non trading or investing use is around. The ability for migrant workers to send their funds directly to their family, with the minimum fees involved.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When we look at international businesses who have Ukrainian and Russian workers and still need to pay salary, crypto provides an option where there was not one before. And I think in this world that we are living in where potentially we&#8217;re looking at splinternets like you know the great fire wall of China. The Russian internet, if things continue the way they&#8217;re going having means for value transfer and coordination that is free from the constraints of nation states, might suddenly become super important to everyone. There&#8217;s also that element that I think is interesting and worthwhile. Even if the majority of people never understand it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:46] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah the whole decentralized thing, let me rewind. It feels like 25 years ago, proprietary software came on the market and you bought it and then free open source software also in parallel was going on. And I think we&#8217;re at the point where we can tentatively say that free open source software won that ultimately that&#8217;s what I think anyway, if you look at certain segments. So we now have proprietary centralized things and you are advocating for decentralized things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Is it to say that the centralized thing is, it&#8217;s something that we no longer desire? So a good example would be my bank. I wish my bank to have my money and I wish my bank to take care of my money. So that in the event that something happens then I&#8217;ve got some kind of backup.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I know that institution full of those people is there to protect me. In the case of decentralized, I worry that an accidental theft of a phone might be enough to wipe out my life saving. And I wonder if this is a, a real difficult bridge that is never gonna get crossed. So in other words, what makes decentralized so much more superior than centralized? Maybe it doesn&#8217;t, maybe there&#8217;s a place for both forever.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:56] <strong>David Lockie:</strong> Yeah. I think that latter is exactly where I come in. One beautiful concept that came out of web three is this idea of complimentary opposite. So whilst I&#8217;m advocating for people to learn and find out about decentralization and why it can be important and valuable. I&#8217;m definitely not saying like centralized stuff is bad.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And actually when we look at a few examples of success, we see that anyway. Automattic, WordPress.com also WordPress.org. Arguably neither would be as successful without the other, but like combined, it means that where a centralized entity can be most impactful like, things can go down that route. Where there are opportunities to do stuff that a centralized organization simply can&#8217;t do the .org ecosystem can do it, it can innovate at the edges.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that&#8217;s, I think a very resonant example from the world we know. In crypto, there are some other examples as well. For example, there&#8217;s a crypto exchange called Binance. It&#8217;s a centralized, regulated KYC, AML, OFAC entity. You know it&#8217;s a financial organization and company that pays its taxes et cetera, but it also has a decentralized protocol called BSC Smart Chain which is plausibly decentralized and allows it to, allows innovation to happen around Binance whilst not being directly connected to it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think even sort of more traditional businesses like you know arguably what Elon has done with Tesla is to use the power of social media to build this decentralized community of fans around the business. And so one of the tools he uses to achieve his corporate regulated goals is this recruitment of, these people aren&#8217;t employee shareholders not necessarily even customers, but they&#8217;re fans and they&#8217;re motivated towards the same goals for whatever reason. And so it&#8217;s that combination that I think allows for, it just creates a wider, more fertile space for innovation to happen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:54] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah. It&#8217;s more of a more of a marriage and less of a war. Maybe both will coexist and we&#8217;ll figure out which bits work best over here and which bits work best over there as time goes on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:03] <strong>David Lockie:</strong> I also yeah, a hundred percent. I also think it&#8217;s about having checks and balances. Like for me before Bitcoin came along, there was really no, no non-destructive way to protest against the increasing centralization of power. There was nothing to prevent central banks doing whatever they wanted and, for governments to continue to exert pressure. Arguably with the genesis of Bitcoin and permissionless, public, decentralized protocols that can&#8217;t be stopped. If centralization goes too far, then people will flee to alternative currencies that are outside of government control.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s really just my personal take on it. And it&#8217;s not one that everyone&#8217;s comfortable with, but I do think there&#8217;s a sort of, I think it&#8217;s healthy for the, there to be a balancing factor whenever we&#8217;ve got like an axis that&#8217;s out of control, it&#8217;s helpful to balance that out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:52] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Are states able to disable their citizens from accessing this I&#8217;m thinking of China. Is it the case that if you were a citizen of China, you would be enabled to use the very things that you are describing or have they legislated against?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:09] <strong>David Lockie:</strong> It&#8217;s an arms race, isn&#8217;t it? They could block the protocol. But it&#8217;d be very difficult and there would be innovation around it. And the fact that they haven&#8217;t is also kind of interesting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:18] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah. Okay. This isn&#8217;t going away. People are very excited about it. And Automattic have jumped on the bandwagon. Here you are. This is now job. Tell us what the remit of that is in Automattic. Now maybe there&#8217;s a direct connection with WordPress, wordpress.org, wordpress.com. I don&#8217;t know, but just outline what you&#8217;ve been tasked to well either work on already or figure out what you&#8217;re going to work on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:39] <strong>David Lockie:</strong> Sure. And I should mention at this point the conversation that we are having today represents my personal views. Like I&#8217;m still working on the work that I&#8217;m doing within Automattic, and Automattic&#8217;s policy and position on stuff may well, not entirely align with mine. When I approached Automattic about the role, my thesis was that if WordPress and web three will forever remain separate we should understand why that is the case more deeply than just oh, we don&#8217;t like it, it&#8217;s a scam. It&#8217;s whatever.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There were potential touchpoints for the creators that use our platform, the merchants that sell on our platform, the technologies that we integrate, decentralized storage, for example. There are potentially competitors that are gonna emerge in the space.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think there were just so many potential points of disruption for the WordPress community and ecosystem that I love, that I felt I could add some value to the whole ecosystem by increasing awareness, increasing understanding, and trying to bring some more nuance and balance to the dialogue that happens.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it could well be that Automattic does nothing at all with web three, but at least we&#8217;ll understand in a sophisticated way why that&#8217;s the case, why we&#8217;ve made those decisions. My guess is that isn&#8217;t going to happen. In my talk later today, I&#8217;m gonna talk about a couple of use cases that I feel are sort of inevitable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One is around crypto payments. So if we have the four freedoms of GPL, then arguably web three gives us the freedom to transact, the freedom to trade, and that&#8217;s a very ancient historical human trait, to trade to transact. Part of my argument is that&#8217;s what changed us from being hunting, gathering, tribal to societies and civilization, is the ability to trade and transact at increasing scales and over increasing timelines.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So allowing people to not only publish, and sell online, but to transact freely as well, just feels like an obvious thing to do. Why would we not let merchants who don&#8217;t enjoy the financial stability of the US or the UK or whatever, to be able to accept a currency that they wanna accept? It seems like a, like I don&#8217;t see very many valid reasons not to let that happen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As long as we&#8217;re clear about the importance for merchants to do their own research to understand their own risks and to proceed with caution, essentially. To understand what they&#8217;re doing. And that&#8217;s part of my role as well, is to help make sure if we do stuff, then we are trying to educate and inform and raise awareness at the same time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The other one, I think, seems really interesting is NFTs. You know we&#8217;ve seen the weekly active wallet count go from pretty much zero a year ago to like a quarter of a million active wallets every week trading NFTs right now. They are an incredible way for creators to assert their rights and to monetize their content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the most important people in the WordPress ecosystem for me, are the creators that use it. The people who have sites that run WordPress, the merchants who sell through WordPress and WooCommerce. Without them there are no agencies because nobody wants the sites. There&#8217;s no Automattic to provide services out to that ecosystem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it&#8217;s about serving our users. And if creators of all types, writers, photographers, podcasters, musicians, videographers can generate a better fairer, a more durable living by using NFTs and royalties and the rights that it protects than by posting stuff to YouTube and getting 50% of the fees they make from advertising.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, then I think that&#8217;s something that the WordPress community is, it&#8217;s innately supportive of because we support the open web. We support creators. Like we want to give people the freedom to publish and to sell online. And this for me is just an extension of that. People are most free to publish and sell online when they can do that with financial resilience and the ability to protect their income.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:42] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> One of the pieces that I would imagine most people using WordPress are using is just the published button. They&#8217;re not producing videos. They&#8217;re not writing music or creating NFTs. They&#8217;re literally putting out written content and maybe there&#8217;s some images in there, what have you. And I think a curious, maybe underexplored, maybe it&#8217;ll happen, I don&#8217;t know, possibly it has, the idea of being able to prove definitively, that thing is mine. And I wrote it on that date and I can prove it forever. And I think that might be a curious, there&#8217;s no real financial benefit to that, but it&#8217;s a nice, almost legal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:27:13] <strong>David Lockie:</strong> There&#8217;s a company, WordProof who do exactly this, right. And there are a couple of really interesting use cases there. To speak to the sort of monetization bit, a lot of money is made through search engine ranking. And content theft and plagiarism, like are all problems for publishers, real problems. So if we can find a way to help search engines, parse who definitively created this bit of content, then that will protect the original content creators to some extent. There&#8217;s a lot of complexity with that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another one is around trust. So if you&#8217;re a merchant and you&#8217;ve got like a shipping policy, a refund policy, general terms, and you timestamp them and you transparently show that something has changed and when it changed, then that builds trust with your consumer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a consumer, I trust that this store isn&#8217;t gonna change its refund policy and leave me high and dry if like the refund period has changed since I bought it, how can I prove that definitively? So there are some direct monetization opportunities, but also some indirect ones as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:12] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Unfortunately we&#8217;re running out of time. So I&#8217;m just gonna ask one final question. If people are interested to find out more generically or it might be via you, what would be one or two of the quickest places to swot up on this topic?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:24] <strong>David Lockie:</strong> So there&#8217;s a web three educational community called Kernel that I would recommend to anyone. It&#8217;s a very holistic and quite philosophical look at this technology. And if I can remember the link correctly, it&#8217;s bit.ly, so B I T dot L Y forward slash all caps, W P K B 7. So that&#8217;s whiskey papa kilo bravo seven.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s also a bunch of learn to earn platforms out there. A good one to start with is rabbit hole, dot gg. rabbithole.gg. And there you can earn small amounts of crypto for learning to use a digital wallet or a decentralized exchange, or any of these other decentralized applications. So that&#8217;s a good, more guided, more practical way to start experiencing these technologies. And I think that experiencing it, whether you&#8217;re buying like $10 of crypto, whether you are signing up to a web three platform, actually just using this stuff is the best way to learn.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s very immersive and there&#8217;s a lot to get your head around. Just reading stuff. You&#8217;ll be reading for years and you might still not get it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:31] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> David Lockie.

This week the Envato community found out that these legacy platforms include Envato Studio and Twenty20.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many Envato Studio service providers, who have completed more than 230,000 jobs since it launched in 2014, were surprised to learn that Envato is giving them under two months notice before it shutters the service on August 21. Providers have built their profiles with positive reviews for their work on creative projects &#8211; everything from logo design to WordPress customization. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;It is not just bad news &#8211; it is a shocking news for me and to all who consider Envato Studio as a main earning source,&#8221; express customization provider WonderArt <a href=\"https://forums.envato.com/t/envato-studio-and-twenty20-to-close/421413/5\">said</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;How I run my family now, it will take a long time to restart my marketplace earning again.

I am very much disappointed by this decision.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some saw the writing on the wall after Envato stopped investing in the platform and new clients and orders were dwindling. Others, for whom Envato Studio was their main source of income, are shocked and scrambling to find a new way to support themselves on short notice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Many of us rely on the steady income from express services to make a living, so really in my case such an abrupt and inconsiderate closure affects me greatly and hits me very hard, especially as I have two young children and a family to continue to support, plus bills that will keep coming in,&#8221; user touringxx <a href=\"https://forums.envato.com/t/envato-studio-and-twenty20-to-close/421413/31\">said</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;With thousands of jobs done on my part (1733+) and 100% buyer satisfaction, I have put a lot of effort and patience into building and maintaining that reputation over the years, to now see it simply disappear as if it were worthless.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After investing so many years building their profiles and serving clients, multiple longtime Envato Studio service providers begged for more time before closing the platform.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;This is not a good and fair decision in the middle of an economic crisis, we have spent our time here for 8-9 years and more, you should give more time before closing the platform,&#8221; one user Nofomsok <a href=\"https://forums.envato.com/t/envato-studio-and-twenty20-to-close/421413/11\">said.</a> &#8220;It&#8217;s just not fair.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With under two months notice on the platform shutting down, many participants in the discussion said they felt the transition was too abrupt. They suggested six months to prepare for the shift, as well as creating a static, read-only version of the platform where clients can browse through service providers and send them messages through their profiles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;It is incredible how Envato doesn’t at least comment on this matter, we are waiting to hear from them is this the treatment we deserve for so many hardworking years?&#8221; @jassdesigngroup said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We are real people with families, not just numbers.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Envato eventually did respond, indicating they are listening to feedback but did not mention an extension of the timeline for shutting down the platform.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We are in the process of creating a solution that will hopefully help with your Studio reviews,&#8221; an Envato representative commented.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These additional considerations may be too late for those who had all their eggs in one basket.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;It’s a business decision that is up to you,&#8221; hibiscustechno <a href=\"https://forums.envato.com/t/envato-studio-and-twenty20-to-close/421413/40\">commented</a>. &#8220;But this transition is passing a big message to the creative members in ThemeForest, &#8216;Hey guys, Today we burned all together, You authors have the time to save yourselves by selling your products using your own website rather than giving $$ commission to a platform and keep the clients with you.\'&#8221;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 06 Jul 2022 01:23:59 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:39;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:82:\"WPTavern: WordPress Performance Team Proposes Developing a New Plugin Checker Tool\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=135665\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:93:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-performance-team-proposes-developing-a-new-plugin-checker-tool\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4893:\"<p>WordPress&#8217; Performance team is kickstarting a <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/plugins/2022/07/05/proposal-for-a-wordpress-plugin-checker/\">proposal</a> for developing a plugin checker tool similar to the <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/theme-check\">theme check plugin</a>, which ensures themes are meeting the latest standards and best practices.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2021, WordPress&#8217; Meta team <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/meta/2021/02/19/reducing-the-plugin-review-teams-workload-through-automation/\">built a code scanner</a> that detects potential security risks, such as unescaped SQL queries in plugin code, with the goal of reducing the Plugin Team&#8217;s load through automation. That particular tool wasn&#8217;t developed to encourage best practices but rather to ensure plugins entering the directory meet the bare minimum standards necessary for security.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Performance team is proposing building a different kind of plugin that would flag any violations of the plugin development requirements and suggest best practices with errors or warnings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;It should cover various aspects of plugin development, from basic requirements like correct usage of internationalization functions to&nbsp;accessibility, performance, and security best practices,&#8221; Google-sponsored contributor Felix Arntz said. He identified three main goals for the plugin: </p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Provide plugin developers with feedback on requirements and best practices during development.</li><li>Provide the&nbsp;wordpress.org&nbsp;plugin review team with an additional automated tool to identify certain problems or weaknesses in a plugin ahead of a manual review.</li><li>Provide technical site owners with a tool to assess plugins based on those requirements and best practices.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The Performance team recommends the plugin also work from the command line (using WP-CLI) and that it go beyond static code analysis to include runtime checks that execute code.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The proposal has received mixed feedback so far. Several participants in the discussion welcome development on such a tool and would be eager to use it with their own plugins. Others are worried about the checks becoming too heavy-handed and negatively impacting the plugin ecosystem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Having a&nbsp;plugin&nbsp;to automate these checks sounds great,&#8221; WordPress developer Michael Nelson <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/plugins/2022/07/05/proposal-for-a-wordpress-plugin-checker/#comment-44070\">said</a>. &#8220;I worry though that eventually this will mean WP plugin author devs will need to adopt WP’s code style too, which would be pretty annoying.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress developer Josh Pollock <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/plugins/2022/07/05/proposal-for-a-wordpress-plugin-checker/#comment-44071\">commented</a> that he shares these concerns and is worried about how these standards may be applied towards plugins that were not created to support PHP5, use composer for dependency management and automation, and share PHP code with other frameworks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;If this HELPS&nbsp;plugin&nbsp;developers, then fine, but if it is used as a weapon to insist on standards, then I suspect it will be a nail in WP’s coffin,&#8221; plugin developer Robin W <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/plugins/2022/07/05/proposal-for-a-wordpress-plugin-checker/#comment-44072\">said</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;If you want to insist on stuff that is not security critical, then the current documentation is far from useful to rookies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Now if the tool rewrote the code to standard, so the dev got a ‘this is a better version’ then I would be on board.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;But one that just says ‘you are not escaping your code correctly’ and then makes the plugin dev try and find what and where it is wrong will just drive less innovation.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Performance team is requesting feedback from the community, particularly plugin developers, plugin reviewers, and the meta team. If they are able to reach a consensus, Arntz said the next step is to design the infrastructure for the plugin checker in a GitHub repository.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The performance team would be excited to take the lead on this project, but it is vital that additional contributors from other teams help with its development, especially when it comes to defining and implementing the different checks,&#8221; Arntz said. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;This is certainly an ambitious project, and it is not the first time that a plugin checker has come up. It also needs to be clarified that it will likely take a few months at least to get to a first version. However, we are optimistic that with a solid foundation and collaboration from the start, we can create a tool that will meet the requirements for reliable automated plugin checks.&#8221;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 05 Jul 2022 20:52:47 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:40;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:83:\"Do The Woo Community: The Future of Payment with David Mainayar and Robert Windisch\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"https://dothewoo.io/?p=72220\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:51:\"https://dothewoo.io/future-of-payments-woocommerce/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:372:\"<p>David and Robert have a lively discussion around payments, hosting and WooCommerce.</p>\n<p>&gt;&gt; The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://dothewoo.io/future-of-payments-woocommerce/\">The Future of Payment with David Mainayar and Robert Windisch</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://dothewoo.io\">Do the Woo - a WooCommerce Builder Community</a>	.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 05 Jul 2022 09:15:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"BobWP\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:41;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:117:\"Gutenberg Times: Classic Widgets in FSE, 3D Cut-out Image, Open-Source Theme Designs and more – Weekend Edition 221\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/?p=21446\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:122:\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/classic-widgets-in-fse-3d-cut-out-image-open-source-theme-designs-and-more-weekend-edition-221/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:19934:\"<p>Howdy, </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some great Block themes resources are now available.

The organization has historically had a number of public grievances with GitHub, which it outlines on its <a href=\"https://giveupgithub.org/\">Give Up On GitHub site</a>. GitHub&#8217;s public <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/github-makes-copilot-available-to-the-public-for-10-month-free-for-students-and-open-source-project-maintainers\">launch of Copilot</a> last week was the final straw for SFC.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We are ending all our own uses of GitHub, and announcing a long-term plan to assist FOSS projects to migrate away from GitHub,&#8221; SFC Policy Fellow Bradley M. Kuhn said. &#8220;While we will not mandate our existing member projects to move at this time, we will no longer accept new member projects that do not have a long-term plan to migrate away from GitHub.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The SFC&#8217;s member projects include BusyBox, Git, Homebrew, OpenWrt, Buildbot, Houdini, and phpMyAdmin, to name a few. The organization is financially supported by Google, Mozilla, and Redhat, among others.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kuhn said the SFC has been actively communicating with Microsoft and GitHub for a year about concerns regarding Copilot. He claims GitHub ignored invitations to <a href=\"https://lists.copyleft.org/mailman/listinfo/ai-assist\">discussions</a> on <a href=\"https://sfconservancy.org/news/2022/feb/23/committee-ai-assisted-software-github-copilot/\">the moral implications of AI-assisted software</a>, and neglected to answer the SFC&#8217;s questions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Launching a for-profit product that disrespects the FOSS community in the way Copilot does simply makes the weight of GitHub&#8217;s bad behavior too much to bear,&#8221; Kuhn said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Specifically, the SFC is demanding GitHub cite legal precedent for its former CEO&#8217;s claims that <a href=\"https://twitter.com/natfriedman/status/1409914420579344385\">“(1) training ML systems on public data is fair use, (2) the output belongs to the operator, just like with a compiler.”</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The two other questions the SFC could not obtain answers for are as follows:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>If it is, as you claim, permissible to train the model (and allow users to generate code based on that model) on any code whatsoever and not be bound by any licensing terms, why did you choose to <strong>only</strong> train Copilot&#8217;s model on FOSS? For example, why are your Microsoft Windows and Office codebases not in your training set?</li><li>Can you provide a list of licenses, including names of copyright holders and/or names of Git repositories, that were in the training set used for Copilot? If not, why are you withholding this information from the community?</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The SFC contends that Microsoft and GitHub are exploiting FOSS for profit and that its behavior, relative to its peers (Amazon, Atlassian, and GitLab), is markedly worse when it comes to supporting FOSS.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;GitHub also has a record of ignoring, dismissing and/or belittling community complaints on so many issues, that we must urge all FOSS developers to leave GitHub as soon as they can,&#8221; Kuhn said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The SFC formed a committee earlier this year to <a href=\"https://sfconservancy.org/news/2022/feb/23/committee-ai-assisted-software-github-copilot/\">investigate copyleft implications of AI-assisted programming</a>. They are exploring a preliminary finding that <a href=\"https://lists.copyleft.org/pipermail/ai-assist/2022-June/000015.html\">AI-assisted software development can be done in a way that respects FOSS licenses</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;While Microsoft&#8217;s GitHub was the first mover in this area, by way of comparison, early reports suggest that Amazon&#8217;s new CodeWhisperer system <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2022/06/23/amazon_codewhisperer/\">(also launched last week)</a> seeks to provide proper attribution and licensing information for code suggestions,&#8221; Kuhn said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So far SFC&#8217;s call for action has received a tepid response. Although Copilot remains a controversial tool to many, its use of open source code is perceived differently by those who have embraced it as a utility.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;It’s been really useful in beta when I had to make some config files in Ruby, which I rarely use and often forget,&#8221; software engineer Joe Mattiello <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JoeMattiello/status/1542920701887348737?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1542920701887348737%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwptavern.com%2Fwp-admin%2Fpost.php%3Fpost%3D135851action%3Dedit\">said</a>.  &#8220;FOSS is give and take. The point of open-source is to be open. Though any projects that use non-commercial licenses shouldn’t be included if it’s a paid project.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another prevailing opinion is that GitHub didn&#8217;t misuse open source software in training its AI on OSS projects but rather allowed AI to read the source code and learn from it. In this context, the SFC&#8217;s fervent crusade against GitHub for using shared code appears more absurd.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the time being, it appears the SFC is content to continue research with the help of its committee, but part of the organization&#8217;s work is to assist member projects in enforcing the terms of FLOSS licenses, <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/software-freedom-conservancy-receives-court-ruling-affirming-gpl-as-both-copyright-license-and-contractual-agreement\">including through litigation</a>. Its heavy focus on <a href=\"https://sfconservancy.org/copyleft-compliance/\">copyleft compliance</a>, including enforcement of the GPL, may come to bear on Copilot in the future, as the SFC&#8217;s committee learns more about the copyleft implications of AI-assisted programming.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 01 Jul 2022 22:23:12 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:43;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:73:\"WPTavern: WordPress Performance Team Revises Proposal for WebP by Default\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=135677\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:84:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-performance-team-revises-proposal-for-webp-by-default\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7198:\"<p>One year ago, WordPress 5.8 introduced support for WebP, allowing users to upload and use WebP images in their content.&nbsp;In March 2022, the Performance Team moved to expand core support for the image format by <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/performance-team-proposes-enabling-webp-by-default-in-wordpress-6-0\">proposing WordPress enable WebP by default</a>. This would include generating WebP images for new JPEG uploads and using WebP images for website content. In April the controversial proposal was <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-performance-team-puts-controversial-webp-by-default-proposal-on-hold-after-critical-feedback\">put on hold</a> after significant critical feedback.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After months of research, the team has<a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/06/30/plan-for-adding-webp-multiple-mime-support-for-images/\"> reassessed its approach</a> and summarized its findings. The concern about WebP compatibility doesn&#8217;t seem warranted, as <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/performance/issues/290\">research</a> shows more than 97% of web browsers are compatible, as are more than 97% of email clients. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mobile apps have strong compatibility with  iOS 14+ supporting WebP (older versions will be served JPEGs) and Android supporting WebP natively from Android 4.0. The team found all the top RSS readers support WebP. The only outlier in compatibility is Open Graph consumers, which have mixed support.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the chief concerns from prior feedback was that the proposal has the potential to double the amount of disk space used for images, as it would generate WebP thumbnails in addition to the JPEG sub sizes. Performance team contributor Adam Silverstein shared the team&#8217;s findings after surveying hosting companies:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>To assess the overall&nbsp;<a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/performance/issues/289\">impact of generating WebP images on site storage</a>, the team surveyed hosting providers. With a total of 17 responses, the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_si5UPkjC9R5yPPL6FPWfx7jahB8GPb2lrxGpdigYDM/edit?usp=sharing\">results</a>&nbsp;show that the number of stored files is generally not an issue for most hosts/sites, although storage space could become an issue for some users over time. Still, for large hosts (with 1,000 or more hosted sites), the vast majority of sites (&gt; 86%) would be unaffected, even if their storage requirements doubled. We also learned that some lower-end hosting plans with limited storage also lack WebP support in their hosting stack, which means they won’t get extra image generation anyway.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>There may be a few assumptions baked into the statement that &#8220;the number of stored files is generally not an issue for most hosts/sites.&#8221; Responses to the team&#8217;s survey indicated that 58% of users would be unaffected by a doubling of their storage requirements. Only 17 hosts were surveyed and the names of the companies were not included in the data. Even with an estimated 14% of sites at risk of being near capacity, this has the potential to impact millions of WordPress sites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Performance team is proposing a few notable changes to address concerns, including <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/performance/issues/341\">providing a JavaScript snippet</a> that detects browsers that lack WebP support and loads JPEGs instead. Additional WebP by default revisions include the following:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Automatically generating WebP versions of&nbsp;<em>only&nbsp;</em>core image sizes in 6.1 by default.</strong>&nbsp;Custom image sizes will initially have to opt in to receive automatically generated WebP versions, or opt out if they are exclusively used for special cases where WebP is not beneficial or supported.</li><li>Keeping secondary (WebP) sub-sizes&nbsp;<em>only</em>&nbsp;if they are smaller than the primary MIME type.</li><li>Only generating WebP images for image sizes that are intended for use in user-facing front-end content. This avoids wasting storage space for WebP images that will never be used.</li><li>Introducing a&nbsp;filter&nbsp;to control the generation of additional MIME types based on image sub-sizes. This enables developers to exclude certain image sizes, such as those that are not used in front-end content.&nbsp;</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The proposal for WebP by default will only affect new images uploaded after its inclusion in core. It would not automatically generate WebP images for existing uploads. Users who want to convert past uploads would need to use&nbsp;WP-CLI&nbsp;or a&nbsp;plugin&nbsp;like Regenerate Thumbnails.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Revisions to the proposal have so far received mixed feedback. Some are strongly in favor of the new approach and others encouraged the team to consider some of the practical implications for users who may be impacted.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;One can’t simply say it’s OK because &#8216;the vast majority of sites (&gt; 86%) would be unaffected,\'&#8221; WordPress developer Jon Brown <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/06/30/plan-for-adding-webp-multiple-mime-support-for-images/#comment-43278\">said</a>. &#8220;First, 14% is terms of WordPress is a lot. We somehow need to keep supporting the 2.8% of sites still running&nbsp;PHP&nbsp;5.6, but 14% isn’t significant?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;One needs to consider here not just IF, but HOW this 14% of sites will be affected, and not just today, but in the future as well. Will sites just have to smoothly upgrade storage, or will they run out of disk space and crash? Or backups suddenly start failing?&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Multiple participants in the comments suggested WordPress look at adopting the more modern AVIF format, which has better quality and compression when compared to WebP.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Since this initiative is essentially a progressive&nbsp;enhancement, wouldn’t it make more sense to support next-gen formats like AVIF instead while gracefully falling back?&#8221; JavaScript developer Kevin Batdorf said. &#8220;Then browsers will fall into place as they add support over time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Moving to WebP support feels like when WordPress added the&nbsp;REST API&nbsp;while everyone was starting to shift to GraphQL. REST is great, as is WebP, but it’s current gen tech and will feel stale fast.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Performance team contributor Bethany Chobanian Lang <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/06/30/plan-for-adding-webp-multiple-mime-support-for-images/#comment-43290\">said</a> AVIF is <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/performance/issues/11\">on their radar</a>, but its browser support is still lacking at less than 70% of the web. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The conversation continues in the comments of the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/06/30/plan-for-adding-webp-multiple-mime-support-for-images/\">update</a> and Silverstein also encouraged participation on the <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/55443\">Trac ticket</a> for the revised approach.

I’m positive one day (soon) this will be the norm.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It looks like that day has arrived sooner than expected, as Automattic has had a team working on this capability for awhile. Today, a group of eight full-time sponsored Themes Team contributors <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/themes/2022/06/30/create-block-theme/\">released</a> a plugin called <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/create-block-theme/\">Create Block Theme</a> that can create standalone block themes and child themes inside the WordPress admin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The idea is that users can design their own themes using full-site editing features and then export their finished creation as a theme that can be installed on any other WordPress site. Ben Dwyer shared a video called <a href=\"https://automattic.design/2022/03/15/designing-a-theme-in-the-wordpress-editor/\">Designing a theme in the WordPress Editor</a> where designer Beatriz Fialho demonstrated the possibilities. She created a unique new theme using full-site editing features in just a couple of hours.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The plugin offers a variety of exports for different use cases. Users can export their work in the following ways: </p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Export the active theme with user changes included</li><li>Export a child theme with the active theme as the parent theme</li><li>Export a clone a new theme based on the active theme with user changes</li><li>Overwrite the theme files to include the user changes as part of the theme</li><li>Export a blank theme into the site&#8217;s themes directory</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>All of these export options are available under <strong>Appearance &gt;&gt; Create Block Theme</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;This plugin is aimed at theme builders – both designers and developers,&#8221; Dwyer said in the announcement. &#8220;It is useful for sharing your designs between multiple sites or users. If you’re just building a site for yourself you probably don’t need it.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I tested the plugin with the child theme option and it worked as expected. I was able to install it on another site with its unique name and template changes instantly applied. The export screen allows users to give the theme a name, description, and author information, which is saved to the new theme&#8217;s style.css file.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;At the moment the UI of this plugin is totally separate from Gutenberg,&#8221; Dwyer said. &#8220;In time we expect more integration with the Site Editor UI, to make it easier to access these features.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It would be helpful if the theme creation options allowed users to upload a unique screenshot that would be packaged with the theme download. I added this as an <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/create-block-theme/issues/74\">issue</a> on the plugin&#8217;s <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/create-block-theme\">GitHub repository</a>, where anyone is welcome to contribute.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Create Block Theme plugin makes designing and authoring a WordPress theme more approachable than ever before. It has the potential to rapidly increase the number of block themes available, if designers understand how to use it and submit their works to the Themes Directory. The Training Team is currently working on a course for <a href=\"https://learn.wordpress.org/\">Learn WordPress</a> that will teach people how to create block themes using this plugin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/create-block-theme/\">Create Block Theme</a> was released under the WordPress.org plugins account and can be installed by searching for the plugin&#8217;s name in quotes.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 01 Jul 2022 00:39:14 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:48;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:118:\"Post Status: Exiting — and Reentry, Block Themes, GitHub Actions, and Assessing the Pandemic’s Impact on WordPress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:32:\"https://poststatus.com/?p=100001\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:119:\"https://poststatus.com/exiting-and-reentry-block-themes-github-actions-and-assessing-the-pandemics-impact-on-wordpress/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:488:\"The Post Status podcast picks of the week include two takes on selling businesses, going back to work for someone else, and then...
